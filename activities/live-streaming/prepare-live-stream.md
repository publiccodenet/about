# Preparing a live stream

When setting up a new [live stream](index.md) for 'Let's talk about public code' there are some steps to remember.

## Who, when and what

* Decide who will be the next guest
* Decide the date and time of the stream
* Prepare questions for the interview in a HackMD shared with all interviewers
* Share the questions with the guest so no delays happen and they can run it past their communications department if needed
* An ace up your sleeve: backup name in case the current guest can't make it. Ideally, that person would be the next guest
* Update the running script intro and rounding off sections

## Platform preparations

* Make a new intro video with the [BumperScripter](https://github.com/publiccodenet/bumperscripter), adding the guest and organization
* Create a new preview image adding the guest and organization with the help of the [preview image template](preview-image.svg)
* In the week before the stream, create a new broadcast in [StreamYard](../tool-management/streamyard.md)
* Upload the new intro video in Streamyard and remove the old one to avoid confusion during the stream
* Update banners with links related to the upcoming show

## Communication

Make sure these are ready at least 3 weeks in advance:

* Text messages for social media
* Images and graphs that can be used in the communication
* Social media campaign: short video with the guest if possible
* Shared strategy with the stakeholders involved for every interview
