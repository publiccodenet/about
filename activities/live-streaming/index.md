# Live streamed podcast

We use live streams as a tool to communicate. We host a podcast style live stream show called 'Let's talk about public code'.

## Goals

* Become discoverable: create another way for people we would like to know who don't know that we exist or what we do to discover us.
* Grow our codebase's community.
* Get in touch directly with key figures of top projects. Possible way in to steward or make them members of the Foundation for Public Code.
* Get more social media followers since we are going to use those networks for this project.

## Formats, length and schedule

* Frequency: Ambition to make it at least monthly.
* Format: Two different formats - one for codebases, one for the Foundation. For the codebases it is an interview made by two codebase stewards - ideally the community ones - with someone relevant from a codebase. For the Foundation, the format is a conversation between two persons from the foundation. This can be theoretical, about ideas and principles or about news.
* Language: English.
* Script: We get several questions ready before each episode. This builds familiarity with our approach and can also reveal similarities and differences between codebases.
* Length and schedule: Minimum 20 minute livestream during business hours - starting at 14.00 UTC if possible. Promise that the podcast will be live by close of business the next day. Aim to hold this on Tuesdays.

### Guest selection criteria

Guests have an interesting perspective to contribute on the development of public codebase stewardship based on their experience. They can come from anywhere (including non-public open source projects).
The overlap between the guest's experience and our interests should be clear in the invitation, the question guide and our communications for the podcast.

## Target audience

Codebase level:

* Civil servants working on public code codebases (i.e. potential stewardship prospects) and project managers.
* Civic tech people working on codebases in use by public organizations.
* People interested in free and open source software in general.
* People interested by specific types of software.
* Media following up on a particular codebase or use case.
* The codebase being interviewed and its followers.
* Politicians interested in a specific project or city.
* Vendors and technology contractors or subcontractors
* Other people involved in the codebase ecosystem: product managers, designers, user experience, communications, competitors, etc.

## Distribution

We use [Streamyard](../tool-management/streamyard.md) as a tool for the live stream, as it can stream to several platforms at once. For the podcast, we use [Podbean](../tool-management/podbean.md).

## Guides

These guides help us make sure each live stream episode is consistent:

* [Prepare the live stream](prepare-live-stream.md)
* [Manage the live stream](manage-live-stream.md)
* [Post-production](post-production.md)
