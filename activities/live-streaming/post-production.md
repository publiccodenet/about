# Post-producing a live stream

When doing post-production of a 'Let's talk about public code' [live stream](index.md), there are some steps to remember:

* Attendee and viewer follow up: connect them to a call to action such as [sign up for our tailored-to-your-preferences-newsletter](https://odoo.publiccode.net/survey/start/594b9243-c7e5-4bc1-8714-35137c971842).
* Cut an audio version and upload to [Podbean](../tool-management/podbean.md).
  * Cut out long pauses, coughs and other noise, but try to keep the content similar to the recording.
  * Compress and normalize.
  * Cut out the long intro audio for a shorter audio intro.
  * If the outro audio was cut off when the video stream ended, replace it with a complete version of the outro music.
* [Post a blogpost](../communication/blogging.md) with the link to the video and the audio.
  * Include a request for feedback from the audience.
* Some time after the show, take a look at the metrics (number of views, number of people that signed up, increase in number of leads that reach out to us later on, number of clicks in our blogposts, videos, audio, social media, etc.). Iterate, engage and act according to prior data.
* Send guest a thank you email with request for feedback.
