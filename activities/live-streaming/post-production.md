# Post-producing a live stream

When doing post-production of a 'Let's talk about public code' [live stream](index.md), there are some steps to remember:

* Create an audio version of the podcast.
  * Download the audio files from Streamyard, either using the direct link when ending the stream, or by finding them in the "Library" later.
  * Use the [Audacity project template](https://files.publiccode.net/nextcloud/index.php/s/aEoGGTNbJzw6iGx) to get started.
  * Cut out long pauses, coughs and other noise, but try to keep the content similar to the recording.
  * Compress and normalize.
* Upload to [Podbean](../tool-management/podbean.md), the operations coordinator can share login details through our 1Password.
  * Create a thumbnail for the episode using the [thumbnail template](https://files.publiccode.net/nextcloud/index.php/s/kHPQ3ZS2nHgxA5S).
* [Post a blogpost](../communication/blogging.md) with the link to the video and the audio.
  * Include a request for feedback from the audience.
* Update stream destinations
  * Fix the tense in the language of the description
  * If possible, add the recording to a playlist
  * Optionally, add subtitles
* Update Odoo by moving the card to the Produced column.
* Send the guest a thank you email with request for feedback and links to the episode and blog post.
  * Connect them to a call to action such as [sign up for our tailored-to-your-preferences-newsletter](https://odoo.publiccode.net/survey/start/594b9243-c7e5-4bc1-8714-35137c971842).
* Some time after the show, take a look at the metrics (number of views, number of people that signed up, increase in number of leads that reach out to us later on, number of clicks on our blogposts, videos, audio, social media, etc.). Iterate, engage and act according to prior data.
