# Membership onboarding support

Membership of the Foundation for Public Code includes an onboarding support 'starting pack' to help members get started and prepare for their first General Assembly.

## Onboarding support

This onboarding includes us providing members with trainings, workshops and a helpdesk on:

* open source policy
* procurement of open source
* what the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net) can mean for members, both in internal development and procurement
* general awareness on what open source is, what codebase stewardship is, and how this can benefit members
* value proposition mapping and business case development for members
* [connecting to the community](../communication/community-discussions.md) of the Foundation of Public Code

And supporting members with their codebases on:

* assessment of codebases for [codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/index.md)
* quality of codebases - understanding how to make them more modular and reusable
* community for codebases - understanding how to collaborate better and more openly with other organizations
* product packaging of codebases - understanding how to better market and promote codebases
* support of codebases - understanding how to improve collaboration with the market

Please note that as an association, we allocate our resources across members. Our support for members is subject to availability.
