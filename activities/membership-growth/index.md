# Membership growth

We support potential members in their path towards membership.

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-owned association. Only wholly publicly owned organizations may become members. Members participate in the steering and governance of the association by voting at the General Assembly. They also participate by financing the association through yearly dues.

## Membership benefits and responsibilities

Members benefit from [codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/index.md), [member onboarding support](member-onboarding-support.md) and the other [value propositions](member-onboarding-support.md) of being part of the community.

Members are responsible for the association's [governance](../../organization/governance-model.md) and [financing](../../organization/financial-model.md).

## How to become a member

1. Sign the [expression of interest](expression-of-interest.md) to allow both parties to work together in the open.
2. Review the [member onboarding](member-onboarding-support.md) proposal and discuss with Foundation for Public Code staff members.
3. Agree on your member dues and the [articles of association](../../organization/articles-of-association.md), and sign the [membership contract](membership-contract.md).
