# Community discussions

We have a forum for community discussions at: [discuss.publiccode.net](https://discuss.publiccode.net).

## Purpose

The forum is a space for our community to talk publicly about topics that does not naturally fit anywhere else.

## When to not use the forum

The forum doesn't replace:

- making issues on Github
- our internal chat (Odoo Discuss)
- internal emails

## Further reading

- To learn about the tool through an interactive tutorial, bookmark the Greetings message from the user [Discobot](https://discuss.publiccode.net/u/discobot/summary).
