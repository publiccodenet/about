# How we handle videos

When we generate videos, we have two ways of handling them on our own platforms.
We use [Google Workspace](../tool-management/google-workspace.md) to store our raw videos for internal sharing and our [Nextcloud](../tool-management/nextcloud.md) to publish videos.

## Raw videos

Raw videos that will be used for editing are stored and shared with colleagues on the Drive in Google Workspace.
We have unlimited storage space.

## Publish videos

To publish videos on our own platform, we use Nextcloud.
Create a folder named `Shared folder` in the files app to make it explicit that files in that folder are meant to be shared.
Upload videos that are meant to be pulished to that folder.
To make the file publicly accessible, click the share icon and then **Share link** to copy a link through which anyone can access the file.
Note that our storage space is not unlimited, but we can increase the amount if you reach the limit.

## External platforms

We also use our [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXIL94kkenw0cs_ZgNhKYuw) for publishing videos and we [do livestreams](../live-streaming/index.md) to all our social media accounts.
