# Using [chat.publiccode.net](https://chat.publiccode.net/) for staff

We use Mattermost, hosted at chat.publiccode.net, for informal chat purposes.

Mattermost lets us create multiple teams with different members.

We have 2 teams right now:

* our staff team
* North America team

## Guidelines

Discussions on chat.publiccode.net are:

* timely
* optional
* secret

Send an email for all non-optional interactions.

### Channels

We have channels that reflect our work, plus some crosscutting topics.

Feel free to create new channels as you discover you need them.

When creating a new channel for an [activity documented on About](../index.md), please standardize the label between chat.publiccode.net and about.publiccode.net - what we talk about is the most honest reflection of what we're actually doing.

## Getting started

Take these steps to join the staff team.

1. The operations coordinator will send you an invitation.
2. Set up your account.
  Please use the same name from as your email address as your username so itâ€™s easy to see whoâ€™s who.
  Also, please upload an avatar (ðŸ‘¹) and fill in your full name.
3. Join relevant channels!
4. Add integrations.
  We encourage you to `/github connect`.
  You may also want to add `/github settings notifications off` and `/github settings reminders off` if you don't want Mattermost to send you emails about Github issues or pull requests you're subscribed to.
5. Say hi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹.
