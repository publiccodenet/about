# Using and managing VOIP phone numbers

We use voice over IP (VOIP) technology for all Foundation for Public Code telephone numbers.
Read how to:

* [use the phone number with the app on your mobile phone](using-phone-app.md)
* [add a user and phone number](adding-a-phone-user.md)

Phone numbers and lines are managed in our VOIP supplier Voys' [online management tool](https://freedom.voys.nl/).
It contains the following and more:

* ['Dial plans'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/routing/): What number is routed where and what happens then
* ['Users'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/user/): Who can log in
* ['VoIP accounts'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/phoneaccount/): Basically lines we can assign
* ['Voicemails'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/voicemail/): Voice mail boxes
