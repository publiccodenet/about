## Synchronous communication

We meet our community regularly by [attending and running events](../events) and [workshops](../workshops), and by [hosting community calls](../community-calls).

### Community calls

Community calls are a way to get direct input from the Foundation for Public Code community on topics that in any way are of concern to them. We host community calls regularly and they are open for anyone to join.

We believe it's important to be able to reach a human quickly if you have a question.
