# Communication

These are all the activities, documents and templates for Communication.

* [Communication principles](communication-principles.md)
* [Instructions on how to run a community call](run-a-community-call.md) 
* [Phone numbers](phone-numbers.md)

Community calls are a way to get direct input from the community on topics that in any way are of concern to them. We do them on a bi-weekly schedule for regularity and they are open for anyone to join.

## Using and managing phone numbers

* [Using the phone number with the app on your mobile phone](using-phone-app.md)
* [Adding a user and phone number](adding-a-phone-user.md)

Phone numbers and lines are managed in our VOIP supplier Voys' [online management tool](https://freedom.voys.nl/). It contains the following and more:

* ['Dial plans'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/routing/): What number is routed where and what happens then
* ['Users'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/user/): Who can log in
* ['VoIP accounts'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/phoneaccount/): Basically lines we can assign
* ['Voicemails'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/voicemail/): Voice mail boxes
