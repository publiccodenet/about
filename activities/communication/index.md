# Communication

These are all the activities, documents and templates for Communication.

* [Communication principles](communication-principles.md)
* [Phone numbers](phone-numbers.md)

## Using and managing phone numbers

* [Using the phone number with the app on your mobile phone](using-phone-app.md)
* [Adding a user and phone number](adding-a-phone-user.md)

Phone numbers and lines are managed in our VOIP supplier Voys' [online management tool](https://freedom.voys.nl/). It contains the following and more:

* ['Dial plans'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/routing/): What number is routed where and what happens then
* ['Users'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/user/): Who can log in
* ['VoIP accounts'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/phoneaccount/): Basically lines we can assign
* ['Voicemails'](https://freedom.voys.nl/client/415559/voicemail/): Voice mail boxes

## Email signature

In order to clearly convey who is communicating, this template for email signature could be used. It has no styling in order to make it more probable that email clients and mailing lists will handle the signature gracefully.
