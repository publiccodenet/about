# Foundation for Public Code community call

We run regular [community calls](../community-calls/index.md) for the Foundation for Public Code.
These invite our community to join us in discussing big questions, approaches we're considering for the future or things we've learned.

[See the community calls guidance](../community-calls/index.md) for our current community call schedule, how to join and guidance on how to run a community call.

[See notes from previous community calls](https://blog.publiccode.net/) on our blog.
