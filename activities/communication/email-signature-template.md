# Email signature template

We can use a standard email signature to clearly convey who is communicating and build trust.

It has no styling to make it more probable that email clients and mailing lists will handle the signature gracefully.

```
Name, Role
Email | Phone | Twitter | Mastodon
Foundation for Public Code https://publiccode.net
```

Example:

```
Boris van Hoytema, Chief Executive and secretary
boris@publiccode.net | +31 20 2 444 555 | @bvhme
Foundation for Public Code https://publiccode.net
```
