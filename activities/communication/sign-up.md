# Managing newsletter and community call sign up

We use [Odoo](../tool-management/odoo.md) to manage the sign up process. The modules we use are Surveys and Contacts. In Odoo we have a survey called *Newsletter and community calls*, which configures the [sign up form](https://odoo.publiccode.net/survey/start/594b9243-c7e5-4bc1-8714-35137c971842).

Share the link to this form whenever we communicate with people who might want to stay in touch with us.

## Update contacts

Update Odoo Contacts before sending out [invitations to community calls](../standard-maintenance/preparing-community-call.md) or the newsletter. The notes at the bottom of the survey will say when Contacts was last updated. In the top right corner of the survey is a button showing how many answers the survey has. Click it to see all the people that have signed up and for what. Download a file of all new contacts by:

* selecting all the people (survey responses) with a 'Created on' date since the contacts were last updated
* clicking the download button in the top left corner

With the details from the file, update existing contacts or create new ones. Use the tags 'Newsletter', 'Community Call / Foundation', 'Community Call /Standard' and 'SendValuable' to store their preferences for being contacted.

## Log the update

After the contacts have been updated, use the function **Log note** in the bottom of the survey to leave a message that contacts have been updated (a timestamp will be added automatically).

Delete the contacts file you downloaded, so that we can be confident we're GDPR compliant.
