# Enabling policies

Policies supporting open source development can make it easier for civil servants to convince their peers that they should engage.
These policies can take many forms, from laws to internal guidance.
The clearer and more specific the policy is, the more likely that it is that it will persuade skeptics.

Some examples (non-exhaustive list):

* [Bulgarian electronic governance law](https://lex.bg/laws/ldoc/2135555445) (in Bulgarian), requiring software developed through public contracts to be open source ([English news article](https://web.archive.org/web/20230204230815/https://www.techrepublic.com/article/bulgaria-mandates-government-code-be-open-source-should-other-countries-follow-suit/))
* [UNESCO endorsement](https://en.unesco.org/freeandopensourcesoftware), an example of a general positive endorsement
* [UK Service Manual: Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)
* [Swedish Agency for Digital Government internal software development policy](https://www.digg.se/download/18.5b0eb5a018018072bd81c5cf/1657096012152/Policy%20f%C3%B6r%20utveckling%20av%20programvara.pdf) (in Swedish), requiring software to be open source and specifies which licenses to use

## How to find policies for your country
