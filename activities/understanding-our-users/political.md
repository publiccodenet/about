# Political

This group includes political leaders at these levels:

* supranational (for example the European Union)
* national
* inter-regional
* membership bodies (for example associations of cities)
* provincial
* municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* translating policy changes into tech solutions
* responding to public opinion becoming more critical of tech giants
* having a place to preserve work before leaving office
* increased ability to involve local partners and stimulate the local economy
* getting access to higher level government funding

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* public data and processes are owned by private actors
* poor resident experience is politically costly
* companies evolve to rip off government
* huge government IT projects have a high failure rate
* political change resulting in the undoing of previous successes

## Our value proposition for them

We enable:

* reflecting policy accurately by tech implementation
* increasing local control (technological sovereignty)
* strengthening the local economy
* building lasting value that transcends the political cycle
