# Creating affiliations

Partnership is only open to public organizations.
Other organizations that we collaborate with can become [affiliates](../../glossary/affiliate-definition.md).

[See our current affiliates](../../organization/affiliates.md).

If you're interested in being affiliated with us, or have any questions, please email us at <info@publiccode.net>.

## Resources

To declare the affiliation, [the affiliate template](affiliate-template.md) can be of help.
