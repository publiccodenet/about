# Creating affiliations

The Foundation for Public Code is a [member-owned association](../member-relations/index.md).
Membership is only open to public organizations.
Non-profit organizations that we collaborate with we can become [affiliates](../../glossary/affiliate-definition.md).

[See our current affiliates](../../organization/affiliates.md).

If you're interested in being affiliated with us, or have any questions, please email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.
