# How to run the 'Mapping risk and service level agreements' workshop

## Introduction

Work through the [agenda](/agenda-template.md), making sure the respective speakers have prepared their bits, and there is ample emphasis on openness and vulnerability, as well as giving each participant an equal voice.

## Breakout workshops

Explain the [canvas](/mapping-risk-and-service-level-agreements-template.pdf) and make sure everyone has a chance to ask questions.
Explain the online tool you are using, if required.

In round 1, for question 1 and 2, ask participants to add 2-3 post-its.
After, talk through and cluster the contributions.

In round 2 and 3, if the group is small, ask participants to add post-its for each quadrant on the canvas.
Close this with a talk through and clustering.
If the group is larger and you are concerned about time, you can have a group discussion and the facilitator can capture main discussion points on post-its.

Try avoid a single organization, whether public or private, having more representatives in a group than other groups.

## Closing

Invite each breakout group to give a short recap of the most important insights from their group. If there is time, invite individuals to give their closing remarks. Be sure to end with next steps where possible.
