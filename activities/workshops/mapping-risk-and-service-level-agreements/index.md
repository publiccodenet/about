# Mapping risk and service level agreements workshop

## Goal

Have a collaborative working session with new or existing community members to map out, for a given codebase, potential different risks when using the codebase in production, as well as approaches to service level agreements.

## Considerations

Discussions about service level agreements can get very technical quite quickly.
Try steer the workshop on what the most important risks are according to the participants.
Verify this by asking participants to prioritize risks by their impact and likelihood.
Ask what process can be followed to mitigate these risks.
