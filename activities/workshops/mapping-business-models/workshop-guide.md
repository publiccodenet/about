# How to run the 'Mapping business models enabled by a codebase' workshop

## Introduction

Work through the [agenda](agenda-template.md), making sure the respective speakers have prepared their bits, and there is ample emphasis on openness and vulnerability, as well as giving each participant an equal voice.

## Breakout workshops

Explain the [canvas](Mapping-business-models-canvas-template.pdf) and make sure everyone has a chance to ask questions.
Explain the online tool you are using, if required.

For each question, ask participants to add 2-3 post-its.
After each round, take a step back, talk through the post its, cluster them, and ask the group to prioritise.

Try avoid a single organization, whether public or private, having more representatives in a group than other groups.

## Closing

Invite each breakout group to give a short recap of the most important insights from their group.
If there is time, invite individuals to give their closing remarks.
Be sure to end with next steps where possible.
