# How we receive donations

We can accept donations to our bank account: NL78 RABO 0342 6453 31 in the name of "Foundation for Public Code Vereniging" in Amsterdam.
Encourage people to include "donation" in the description.

## Tax deductibility

As we are an ANBI (public benefit organization), donations can be deducted from Dutch income tax returns.
However, the conditions are different for a repeated (periodic) gift and one-off (ordinary) gift.

### Periodic donation

A donation is a periodic donation if it meets one of the following 3 conditions:

* The same amount is gifted annually to the same institution or association. This can be payed in one go, or in instalments.
* The amount is payed at least 5 years in a row.
* There is a predetermined end to the donations. For example, after 5 years, or when the person passes away.

### Ordinary donation

An ordinary donation is a donation made only once, or a donation made annually which is not documented in an agreement.
This may be deducted if it meets all the following conditions:

* The donation will go to an ANBI (public benefit organization)
* The donation is voluntary
* There is nothing given in exchange for the donation
* The gift can be proven through, for example, from the withdrawals from your account
