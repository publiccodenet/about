# How we receive donations

We can accept donations to our bank account: NL78 RABO 0342 6453 31 in the name of "Foundation for Public Code Vereniging" in Amsterdam.
Encourage people to include "donation" in the description.

## Tax deductibility

You may deduct a donation to an ANBI (public benefit organization) in your Dutch income tax return. However, the conditions are different for a repeated (periodic) gift and one-off (ordinary) gift.

### Periodic donation

Your donation is a periodic donation if it meets one of the following 3 conditions:

* You give the same amount annually to the same institution or association. You may decide for yourself whether you pay your annual donation in one go, or in instalments.
* You pay the amount at least 5 years in a row.
* You have determined when your annual donation stops. For example, after 5 years, or when you pass away.

### Ordinary donation

An ordinary donation is a donation you only make once, or a donation that you make annually, but have not documented in an agreement. You may deduct your ordinary donation if it meets all the following conditions:

* Your donation will go to an ANBI (public benefit organization)
* Your donation is voluntary
* You get nothing in exchange for your donation
* You can prove that you have made the gift. This can be seen, for example, from the withdrawals from your account
