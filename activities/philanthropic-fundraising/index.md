# Philanthropic fundraising

Our [financial model](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/financial-model.html) includes raising philanthropic funds. Gifts are tax-deductible in both the Netherlands and the US.

These resources support our philanthropic fundraising:

* [our philanthropy policy](../../organization/philanthropy.md)
* [our case for support (A4 PDF)](foundation-for-public-code-case-for-support-A4.pdf) explains the impact of making a philanthropic gift to the Foundation for Public Code (also available as a [US Letter PDF](foundation-for-public-code-case-for-support-letter.pdf))
* how to [donate to us in The Netherlands](donating-netherlands.md)
* how to [donate to us from the U.S.](donating-united-states.md)
