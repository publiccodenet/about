# Office and building management

Our office houses the beating heart of the organization. We're all responsible for keeping it working and enjoyable.

The office is located at:
Keizersgracht 617
1017 DS Amsterdam

We have an anti-squat contract (bruikleenovereenkomst) with K&O Group, which manages the property on behalf of the owner, Hansainvest GmbH. The contract ends on 30 June 2021 with the possibility of extending it on a month-to-month basis until the building is rented again.
