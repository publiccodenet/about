# Process for recruiting and hiring candidates

## Roles in this process

* Head of human resources (HRM), responsible for the hiring process
* Chief Executive (CEO), responsible for who we hire
* Chief Operations (COO), responsible for how this person works in the organization
* Directors Foundation for Public Code (BOD), responsible for oversight

## Announcing job opening

We publish all job postings on the [Publiccode.net](https://publiccode.net) website. We also use the current team's network to spread awareness of the job opening (via email, LinkedIn, social media). We may use (specialized) job sites and recruiters.

## Processing reactions of people expressing interest

Questions about the content of the position are routed to CEO. Questions about the hiring procedure and the conditions are routed to HRM. Applications are sent to HRM for processing.

## Planned recruitment and hiring process

1. Current job openings have no closing date and applications are considered on a rolling basis. When we find a suitable candidate, we hire and close the opening. This means applications are considered ‘by themselves’ and not ‘in competition’ with a certain set of other applications.
2. HRM confirms receipt to candidates and does first round of evaluation.
3. HRM brings possibly suitable candidates to the attention of CEO and the role's future supervisor. These 2 make +/- judgement, without consulting each other. If judgement is not equal, a short discussion follows and judgement is made.
4. HRM notifies candidates (thank you or invitation for interview).
5. First interview: CEO and HRM, 1 hr, partially on the basis of a pre-established list of desirable competences and other characteristics (i.e. fit for role, fit for organization (culture, growth, leadership, long/short term)). Half of the interview is spent presenting PublicCode.net, in the other half, the candidate has a chance to present themselves. Immediately after the interview both HRM and CEO score the candidate on the items on the list and determine if the candidate should progress to a second interview.
6. Second interview: COO with HRM, also partially based on the pre-established list, and with attention to issues not discussed in the first interview. Approximately. 80-90% of the time is spent on questioning the candidate. Immediately after the interview HRM and COO score the candidate, based on the list and other impressions gathered. HRM takes this input to CEO, and HRM and CEO determine if the candidate should receive an offer.
7. CEO and HRM determination of the offer, including salary range and benefits.
8. Third interview, hopefully a formality, of the preferred candidate with a BOD member (of the legal entity hiring).
9. HRM makes the offer to the candidate and negotiates, always in consultation with CEO and the director(s).
10. Signing of contract and starting by the new team member, supervised by their hierarchical supervisor.
