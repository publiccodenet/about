# Conflict of Interest introduction

The Foundation for Public Code is maturing, and we are implementing a formal Conflict of Interest policy and procedure to ensure professionalism as well as doing our due diligence as a publicly-owned association. A Conflict of Interest has to be declared annually. New hires will receive a form to declare any possible Conflict of Interests at the time of signing their employment contract. To ensure there are no Conflict of Interests within the current team, we will ask them to declare conflicts, if any, retroactively. The Operations coordinator will facilitate the process.

## Conflict of Interest policy

The purpose of a Conflict of Interest policy is to help a director, director of the board, employee, contractor, or volunteer (collectively “Interested Party”) of the Foundation for Public Code to identify and disclose a personal Conflict of Interest. The policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable laws governing Conflict of Interest applicable to commercial, nonprofit and charitable organizations.

Interested Parties, by the very nature of their roles within the Foundation for Public Code, are always in a position to exploit their positions for personal gain. The policy provides definitions, guidelines and procedures which, if followed, may allow a Conflict of Interest to be discovered and voluntarily defused before any misconduct or the perception of misconduct occurs.

A Conflict of Interest is not the same as actual wrong-doing. However, a perceived Conflict of Interest outside of actual wrongdoing - especially if non-disclosed or poorly managed, may still lead to public misunderstanding, loss of public confidence and the Foundation for Public Code’s damaged reputation. That’s why it is critical to understand the potential relationship between personal and professional interests and how to identify, avoid and disclose such situations.

Interested parties must identify, avoid and disclose an actual or perceived Conflict of Interest. If, because of other work or activities, an Interested Party cannot make this commitment, the Foundation for Public Code may need to take disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.

a. An Interested Party may not take advantage of his/her knowledge or authorities at the Foundation for Public Code for personal gain. Conscious intent to exploit a Conflict of Interest equates to theft. Failure to recognize a personal Conflict of Interest does not absolve an Interested Party from responsibility or punishment.

b. An Interested Party must disclose a potential or perceived Conflict of Interest. Disclosure needs to happen in advance of the transaction or engagement that could lead to personal gain. A Conflict of Interest that results in personal gain, whether willful or by default is one of the most serious ethical violations at the Foundation for Public Code and is punishable up to and including termination.

c. All Interested Parties at hire and on an annual basis thereafter must sign a Conflict of Interest policy acknowledgment and disclosure form. Thereafter, Conflicts of Interests should be disclosed as they arise.

## Common Examples of Conflict of Interest

* Having a direct or indirect financial interest in, or relationship with a relative, competitor, customer, or supplier
* Committing the Foundation for Public Code to give its financial or other support to any outside activity or organization without appropriate written authorization
* Accepting personal gifts or entertainment from competitors, customers, suppliers, or potential suppliers. [See our code of conduct.](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/staff-code-of-conduct.html)
* Working for a competitor, supplier, or customer while employed by the Foundation for Public Code
* Engaging in self-employment in competition with the Foundation for Public Code
* Using proprietary or confidential Foundation for Public Code information for personal gain or to the Foundation for Public Code’s detriment
* Acquiring an interest in property or assets of any kind for the purpose of selling or leasing it to the Foundation for Public Code

## Duty to disclose

It is the duty of an Interested Party to be aware of this policy, and to disclose conflicts as they arise as well as to disclose those situations that are evolving that may result in a Conflict of Interest or an appearance of conflict. Advance disclosure must occur so that a determination may be made as to the appropriate plan of action to manage the conflict or the appearance of conflict.

## How to Disclose

A disclosure can be made one of two ways:

Interested Party discloses to Supervisor. Supervisor must disclose to the Operations coordinator. The Operations coordinator evaluates the disclosure, elevating to Chief Exexcutive if necessary.

Or,

Interested Party discloses to the Operations coordinator. The Operations coordinator evaluates the disclosure, elevating to the Chief Executive if necessary.

### Information to Include in a Disclosure

Be prepared to describe fully any relationships, transactions, positions you hold (volunteer or otherwise), or circumstances that you believe could contribute to a Conflict of Interest between the Foundation for Public Code and your personal interests, financial or otherwise.

### Review of Disclosure and Determination

After disclosure of the Conflict of Interest or perceived Conflict of Interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the Interested Party, a Designated Authority (e.g. the Board of Directors, or a lawyer if it involves a board member) will determine if there is a Conflict of Interest.

### Process if a Conflict of Interest Exists

* If a Conflict of Interest is determined, the Designated Authority will exercise due diligence to determine whether the Foundation for Public Code can obtain with reasonable effort a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would defuse the Conflict of Interest.
* If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under the circumstances, the Designated Authority may determine by a majority vote of the Disinterested Authorities whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Foundation for Public Code's best interest, or for its own benefit, and/or whether it is fair and reasonable.
* In conformity with the above determination it will make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or agreement or terminating the transaction or agreement.

## Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy

If the Designated Authority has reasonable cause to believe an Interested Party has failed to disclose an actual or perceived Conflict of Interest, it will inform the Interested Party of the basis for such belief and afford the interested party an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, after hearing the Interested Party response and after making further investigations as warranted by the circumstances, the Designated Authority determines the interested party has failed to disclose an actual or possible Conflict of Interest, it will take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action, up to and including termination.

## Definition of Terms

* Interested Party, an officer, director, employee, contractor or volunteer of the Foundation for Public Code, who has a conflict of interest or perceived Conflict of Interest, as defined below
* Conflict of Interest, any situation in which an individual is in a position to exploit professional or official capacity in some way for personal gain. In addition, it is a situation where an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions are improperly influenced by considerations of personal gain. The conflict can arise through various relationships including, but not limited to, family relationships, economic relationships and personal or intimate relationships that result in a direct or indirect financial interest in a transaction or arrangement
* Perceived Conflict of Interest, any situation in which an individual may be perceived to be in a position to exploit professional or official capacity in some way for personal gain
* Abused Conflict of Interest, any situation in which an individual intentionally exploits his/her professional or official capacity in some way for personal gain
* Financial Interest, a financial interest includes direct and indirect compensation as well as gifts or favors that are substantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a Conflict of Interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a Conflict of Interest only if the Designated Authority decides that a Conflict of Interest exists
* Designated Authority, an individual appointed to address the Conflict of Interest. The Designated Authority will depend on the nature of the conflict. In some cases, communication between a supervisor, the Operations coordinator and the Chief Executive will resolve the issue. In others, the Board of Directors or a lawyer may be asked to play a role
* Disinterested Authority, an individual eligible to review and evaluate a disclosed Conflict of Interest, who does not need to personally recuse himself/herself as there is no personal conflict of interest within his/her role
