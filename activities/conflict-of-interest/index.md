# Conflict of interest

The [Code of conduct](../../organization/staff-code-of-conduct.md) requires staff members to declare potential conflicts of interest.

## Review declaration

Managers are required to review any declarations of a potential conflicts of interest, by their staff.

If as a manager you are confident the staff member's declaration does not create a situation in which serving the declared interest would work against the interests of the Foundation for Public Code, you should approve the declaration in email or writing.

Otherwise, as soon as possible, schedule a meeting with the staff member to discuss how to resolve the situation.
