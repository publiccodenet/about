# Remote working at the Foundation for Public Code

Everyone is free to work from home as long as they coordinate this with their colleagues and are able to fulfill their role well.

## Information sharing

1. Always CC the relevant group email. Our groups are: stewards, membership, events, giving, invoices, hr, security, Amsterdam-office and everyone (includes everyone with an @publiccode.net email account).
2. We'll use Odoo Discuss instead of Gchat for office conversation. The channels should make it easier for someone in a different time zone to catch up with relevant conversations.
3. We're going to try to work Odoo-first for our secret work, so that we all have access and contribute to the same structured information.

## Meetings

To best support people working remotely during important meetings or events, we'll:

* map out what they'll need at the meeting or event,
* make sure people start working together early enough so we're prepared for the meeting (including contingency),
* schedule a retro after each important meeting or event so we can improve the planning and remote collaboration.
