# Pregnancy, birth, and partner leave

Pregnant employees are entitled to 4-6 weeks pregnancy leave (before the due date)
and at least 10 weeks birth leave.

## Partner leave

You are entitled to 1 week of partner leave after your partner gives birth.

### How to

If you are pregnant you have to let HR know at least 3 weeks before you want to go on pregnancy
leave. But, the sooner you report it, the better, leaving enough time to make any
agreements about your absence, and plan a handover of your tasks. For partner leave, let us know
when your partner has given birth by 9am the next working day.
