# Employment contracts

The employment contract is drafted by the operations coordinator upon agreement on the terms by all parties.
[Onboarding information](onboarding.md) is gathered in advance.
Once the contract is ready, the operations coordinator will upload it to Docusign for signing by the chief executive, chairman of the board and the new employee.
As soon as everyone has signed, a PDF of the signed contract is sent to the employee, followed by a welcome email and our [onboarding package](onboarding.md).
The [contract template is on our Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MQjkagZOo7gHPb1QLfuZUaYzIGVC47r1/edit).

## Employment contract renewals

The operations coordinator keeps track of the contract expiration dates [in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1isVOEetjiaLKMxJHPGPusnBLORxjHUc_/edit#gid=21927936).
The operations coordinator sends a reminder to the executive team about an upcoming renewal 6 weeks in advance, to allow 2 weeks for discussion before the one month notice period.

Employees are told whether their contract will be renewed one month before it expires.
This gives them one month's notice if the contract is not renewed.
One month's notice is the customary in The Netherlands.

When it's decided a contract will be renewed, a talk will to be planned with the employee.
This talk acts as a performance review where the manager and employee can give and receive feedback and vice versa.
This is also when an employee can ask for different terms.

The process is as follows:

* The operations coordinator sends a reminder to the executive team about an upcoming renewal 6 weeks in advance
* Coordinators have the talk with the chief executive
* Codebase stewards have the talk with their coordinators
* Outcome is reported to the operations coordinator

## Service agreements and contractors

We work with contractors and freelancers.
For big or long-term assignments a service agreement is drafted.
For small or short-term assignments a quote suffices.
The operations coordinator takes care of the service agreement, requests time sheets and makes sure invoices are send and paid.
