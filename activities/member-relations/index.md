# Stages to becoming a founding member

This outlines the stages by which a public organization becomes a founding member.

## 1. Expression of interest

At this stage, the public organization confirms their interest in becoming a member by signing the '[Expression of Interest](expression-of-interest.md)'.

The Foundation will start to [collect potential member information](collect-information.md).

## 2. Founding membership proposal

At this stage, the Foundation and the public organization work together on the '[Founding Membership Proposal](founding-membership-proposal.md)'.

This includes identifying:

* [appropriate codebases](identify-potential-codebase.md) for Foundation codebase auditing, certification and stewardship activities
* next steps in the collaboration
* timeline and milestones for 2019

This stage may include a [founding membership workshop](founding-membership-workshop.md).

This stage is over when both parties agree to the proposal.

## 3. Founding membership contract (2019 only)

At this stage, public organizations become founding members by signing a founding membership contract. This contract consists of the proposal agreed in the previous stage, along with any extra legal framing required.

Founding members are co-owners of the Foundation and help shape its future activities and regular membership structure. 

This stage is over after 2019, when the founding members have shaped the Foundation's activities and regular membership structure.

## 4. Membership of the Foundation (2020 onwards)

From 2020, each member will have a regular membership contract.

With a regular membership contract, members become co-owners of the Foundation. This includes steering and setting priorities for the Foundation and voting in the general assembly.
