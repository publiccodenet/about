# Member relations

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-owned association. Only wholly publicly owned organizations may become members. Members participate in the steering and governance of the association by voting at the general assembly. They also participate in the financing of the association through yearly dues.

## What membership is

* members benefit from [codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/index.md), [member onboarding support] and the other [value propositions](member-onboarding-support.md) of being part of the community
* members participate in the [governance](../../organization/governance-model.md) of the association
* members participate in the [financing](../../organization/financial-model.md) of the association

## Steps to becoming a member

1) Sign the [expression of interest](expression-of-interest.md) to allow both parties to work together in the open
2) Review the member onboarding proposal and discuss onboarding with Foundation for Public Code staff members
3) Agree on your member dues and the [articles of association](../../organization/articles-of-association.md), and sign the [membership contract](membership-contract.md)
