# Expression of interest template

## Goal
This document serves as an expression of interest to be signed by public organizations that are exploring joining the Foundation for Public Code as a founding member.  It gives us permission to talk about our working relationship in the open.


## Resource:
You can access the [template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGQYAMkefcEtkblIrJXc6KpIzQZQCjL2QJBDA6wbHfc/edit?usp=sharing)


## Assumptions
* This lightweight/low commitment Expression of Interest can be signed while we work with potential Founding Members on the Founding Membership Proposal
* This resource is a link to a google doc for now, but might change format soon
* Any changes to the content of this template must first be made in About before being propagated into this document

## Use and further development
- [ ] Replace the “[highlighted text]” with customized text
- [ ] Share with potential members
- [ ] Revise template with feedback once shared with 2-3 potential members
