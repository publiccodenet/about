# Expression of interest template

## Goal

This document serves as an expression of interest to be signed by public organizations that are exploring joining the Foundation for Public Code as a founding member.  It gives us permission to talk about our working relationship in the open.

## Resource

You can access the [expression of interest template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGQYAMkefcEtkblIrJXc6KpIzQZQCjL2QJBDA6wbHfc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Assumptions

* This lightweight and low commitment Expression of Interest can be signed while we work with potential Founding Members on the [founding membership proposal](founding-membership-proposal.md)
* This resource is a link to a Google doc for now, but might change format
* Any proposed changes to the content of this template must first be proposed on, and merged with, [the `master` branch of About](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/tree/master) before being implemented here
