# Identifying potential codebases for Foundation Stewardship

This outlines ways in which the Foundation for Public Code identifies potential codebases for Stewardship.

This helps inform individual members and the Foundation about:
* Which existing projects have a need for codebase stewardship
* The best types of use cases for Public Code 

Identified codebases are evaluated according to the [criteria for codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md).

## Research replication of member codebases
Identify which member codebases are currently being reused or being considered for reuse by other Foundation members, and/or their wider networks, in order to help support direct replication.

## Research on use cases for Public Code

Identify which type of software and policy code initiatives most often run into problems with:
* Excessive cost (eg upward spiraling development and/or liscencing costs)
* Excessive risk (eg high failure rate, delays or underperformance )
* Lack of control (eg vendor lock-in or inability to to implement policy code due to proprietary software code)
* Lack of upgrade potential (eg technical debt and reduced agility for future innovation)

## Research on use cases for Codebase Stewardship

Identify which existing codebases public organizations (or other third parties) are currently, or want to in the future, reuse widely as Public Code but which struggle with:
* Stewardship (eg. lack of neutral third party to manage codebase and maintain minimum standards)
* Quality (eg. low reusability and/or lack of appropriate documentation for the codebase)
* Community (eg. no support for an active and long-term community around the codeabse)
* Product (eg. no active marketing to ensure wider reuse of and engagement around the codebase)
* Support (eg. no technical, procurement or legal support for the replication of the codebase)
