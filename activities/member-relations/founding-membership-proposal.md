# Founding membership proposal template

## Goal
This document serves as a draft proposal to send to public organizations that are exploring joining the Foundation for Public Code as a founding member. It serves to formalize our conversation, and work out the next steps and a timeline together.


## Resource: 
You can access the [template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icscB-9jPUF2psL1pm8mM_53BKQ5gEIKqmHnsTicKKY/edit?usp=sharing)


## Assumptions
* Our strategy is to work with our contacts within the organization to make a convincing proposal to their relevant level of political decision-making
* We first send potential founding members this draft full proposal, which invites them to sign a light-weight/low-commitment Expression of Interest. This means we can talk about our working with them in the open, while continuing to tailor the details of this proposal
* This resource is a link to a google doc for now, but might change format soon 
* Any proposed changes to the content of this template must first be proposed and merged with master branch of 'About' before being implemented here 

### Use and further development
- [ ] Share with potential members
- [ ] Revise template with feedback once shared with 2-3 potential founding members
