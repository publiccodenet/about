# Founding Membership Proposal template

## Goal: 
This document serves as a draft proposal to send to public organizations that are exploring  joining the Foundation for Public Code as a Founding Member. It serves to formalise our conversation with them, and work out the next steps and a timeline together with them.

## Resource: 
You can access the template here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icscB-9jPUF2psL1pm8mM_53BKQ5gEIKqmHnsTicKKY/edit?usp=sharing


## Assumptions:
* Our strategy is to work with our contacts within the organization to make a convincing proposal to their highest level of political decision making
* We first send them this draft full proposal, which invites them to sign a light-weight/low-commitment Expression of Interest. This means we can talk about our working with them in the open, while continuing to tailor the details of this proposal
* This resource is a link to a google doc for now, but might change format soon 
* Any changes to the content of this template must first be made in About before being propagated into this document

### Use and Further Development:
- [ ] Share with potential members
- [ ] Revise template with feedback once shared with 2-3 potential members
