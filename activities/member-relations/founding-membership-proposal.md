# Founding membership proposal template

## Goal

This document serves as a draft proposal to send to public organizations that are exploring joining the Foundation for Public Code as a founding member. It serves to formalize our conversation, and work out the next steps and a timeline together.

## Resource

You can access the [founding membership proposal template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icscB-9jPUF2psL1pm8mM_53BKQ5gEIKqmHnsTicKKY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Assumptions

* Our strategy is to work with our contacts within the organization to make a convincing proposal to their relevant level of political decision-making
* We first send potential founding members this draft full proposal, which invites them to sign a light-weight/low-commitment [Expression of Interest](expression-of-interest.md). This means we can talk about our working with them in the open, while continuing to tailor the details of this proposal
* This resource is a link to a Google doc for now, but might change format
* Any proposed changes to the content of this template must first be proposed on, and merged with, [the `master` branch of About](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/tree/master) before being implemented here
