# Information collected about potential members

## Introduction

This resource outlines the information that Foundation for Public Code staff use to map potential member relations.

The information collected is used to structure and keep track of our ongoing relationships with potential members. It is based on our [mission](../../organization/mission.md) and the first iterations of the [founding member proposal template](founding-membership-proposal.md). In line with our communication principles, it is concise and hypertextual where possible. 

As information collected may include personal or sensitive information, this is not public but stored in a private and secure environment.

## Information collected 

* Background:
   * History: Provide a short outline of the organizations' history with open and collaborative code, including for example notable success stories, failures, or strong political movements
   * Aligned projects: Provide a short description of notable public-purpose open and collaborative software and policy
   * Opportunity projects: Provide a short description of notable software and policy with strong potential to become more open, collaborative and/or public-purpose
   * Additional comments: Provide a short description of other initiatives not directly related to, but adjacent to our mission

* Relationship to the Foundation for Public Code:
   * Decision makers: Outline the top two or three budget holders, policy makers and managers who decide on Foundation membership
   * Internal champions: Outline the top two or three internal champions who can help promote our mission and act as ambassadors internally
   * Internal skeptics: Outline the top two or three internal stakeholders who are skeptical of our mission, for whom we can develop and test our value proposition mapping and assumptions
   * Code owners: Outline the top two or three internal stakeholders who own/manage code bases that are, or might be, stewarded by the Foundation
   
* Concrete value propositions and next steps
   * Value proposition: Briefly outline the main value proposition - problem solved or value created - for the member, other members, the Foundation or the general ecosystem. This should be an actionable item.
   * Effort: If possible, provide a sense of estimated effort required (including staff time, contributors, financial etc) and any dificulties you anticipate
   * Next steps: List the main high-level actions and decisions that need to be taken to move foward. Sprint-level details should be captured in tickets on the Kanban board.
   * Repeat above
