# Structural funding and philanthropy

This includes:

* foundations and NGOs
* high net worth individuals

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* get the most out of other tech impact investments
* support many public institutions with one investment
* have an impact on improving services for citizens, reducing risks for governments as well as on new business opportunities for (local) providers

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* Facebook, Uber et al are now seen as villains - winners need to give back
* other NGOs offer one-off solutions and consulting, but what's needed are structural platforms
