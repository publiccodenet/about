# Political

This group includes political leaders at these levels:

* EU
* national
* provincial  
* municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* translate local policy changes into tech solutions
* public opinion shifting towards critique of tech giants
* a place to stash work before leaving office
* involve local partners and stimulate the local economy
* access higher level government funding

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* data and processes owned by private actors
* poor resident experience is politically costly
* companies evolve to rip off government
* high failure rate of huge IT projects
* political change keeps cutting successes of opponent, which are then lost

## Our value proposition for them

We enable:

* policy accurately reflected by tech implementation
* local control (technological sovereignty)
* strengthen the local economy
* building lasting value that transcends the political cycle
