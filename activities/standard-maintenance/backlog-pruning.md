# Prune the Standard backlog

Over time, unresolved issues will gather in the repository.
In order to not forget important ideas and to not become overwhelmed by a huge backlog, we dedicate time to look through our oldest issues to see if they have been resolved, obsolote or can be addressed in other ways.

This work is being done in a backlog pruning session.
The session is open for anyone to attend at [https://meet.publiccode.net/backlogpruning](https://meet.publiccode.net/backlogpruning) and we aim to do one monthly, on the second Thursday of the month, but may skip them if the schedule is too tight.

## Doing a backlog pruning session

1. Before the session, tweet that the session is taking place. Refer to this page rather than giving the direct link in the tweet to reduce the risk of automated "zoom bombing". Tweet template: Starting soon: we're doing another open Standard for Public Code backlog pruning session, at 13:00 UTC. Come hang out with us: [link to this page] #StandardforPublicCCode #govtech #FOSS
2. Start by going through the notes from last month to see if there are issues to close
3. Go through the [issues sorted oldest to newest](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) stating from where the last meeting left off
4. Publish a blog post with the results from the meeting that can be used for point 2 next month ([example](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2021/05/20/pruning-the-oldest-issues.html))
