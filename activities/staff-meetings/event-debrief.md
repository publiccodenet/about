# Event debrief

This is a template agenda for a staff debrief after an event

## Goal

In this session, we consolidate information about an event we participated in and identify next steps.

## Preparation

Individually, develop high level notes on who you met, what you learnt and potential next steps.

## Agenda

1. New contacts:
    * who are the interesting people we met?
    * why do we think they are interesting for us as an organization?
    * what [newsletters, mailing lists](https://odoo.publiccode.net/survey/start/594b9243-c7e5-4bc1-8714-35137c971842) or future events should we invite them to?
    * [process the contacts](../events/process-contacts.md)
2. What could the event and our participation in it mean for:
    * [membership](../member-relations/)
    * [codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/)
    * the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net)
    * developing our community
    * [communications](../communication/)
    * [improving About](../documentation/)
3. Next steps:
    * generate overview of identified next steps
    * assign next steps to a team of owners (at least 2 staff members)
    * define a timeframe, if relevant
    * create issues on GitHub, if relevant
4. Decide if it would be useful to run a [retrospective](retrospective.md) for our preparation, participation and debrief for this event.
