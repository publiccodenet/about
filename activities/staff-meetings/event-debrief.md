# Event debrief

This is a template agenda for a staff debrief after an event

## Goal

In this session, we consolidate information about an event we participated in and identify next steps.

## Preparation

Individually, develop high level notes on who you met, what you learnt and potential next steps.

## Agenda

1. New contacts:
    * who are the interesting people we met?
    * why do we think they are interesting for us as an organization?
    * what newsletters, mailing lists or future events should we invite them to?
2. What could the event and our participation in it mean for:
    * membership
    * codebase stewardship
    * the Standard for Public Code
    * developing our community
    * communications
    * improving About
3. Next steps:
    * generate overview of identified next steps
    * assign next steps to a team of owners (at least 2 staff members)
    * define a timeframe, if relevant
4. Decide if it would be useful to run a [retrospective](retrospective.md) for our preparation, participation and debrief for this event.
