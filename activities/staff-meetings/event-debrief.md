# Event debrief

This is a template agenda for a staff debrief after an event

## Goal

In this session, we consolidate information about an event we participated in and identify next steps.

## Preparation

Individually, develop high level notes on who you met, what you learnt and potential next steps.

## Agenda

1) New contacts:
  * who are the interesting people we met?
  * why do we think they are interesting for us as an organization?
  * what newsletters, mailing lists or future events should we invite them to?

2) What could the event and our participation in it mean for:
  * membership
  * codebase stewardship
  * the Standard for Public Code
  * developing our community
  * communications
  * improving About

3) Next steps:
  * generate overview of identified next steps
  * assign next steps to a team of owners (at least 2 staff members)
  * define a timeframe, if relevant

4) Decide if it would be useful to run a [retrospective](retrospective.md) for our preparation, participation and debrief for this event.
