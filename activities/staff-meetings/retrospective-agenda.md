# Retrospective

## Goal

In this session, we look back at how things went in the team and try to identify what can be done better

## Preparation

What you need to prepare:

* We're going to talk about what went well and what didn't, you can prepare this
* We're going to give team members praise where it is due, so think about what people have done that was exceptional

## Agenda:

1) Short opening
2) Write down (if you have not already) on post-its and keep them with you:
    * Notes on what went well
    * Notes on what went poorly
    * Notes of appreciation
3) One by one everyone puts their notes on the wall explaining them. Whilst doing this the rest  listens, no interruptions except for clarifying questions

4) 5 minute break

5) Group common themes together
6) Prioritise things to discuss together
7) Decide on actions to take, add these to the team backlog as issues
