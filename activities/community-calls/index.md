# Community calls

Community calls are a great way to enable knowledge sharing. The form of video calls allows for an informal and personal connection that can make space for testing thoughts in a way that is hard to do in an issue tracker. We help you get started with community calls for your codebase and may participate from time to time.

We organize a video call for our own codebases the first Thursday of the month (currently only the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net)). The call lasts less than an hour and usually focuses on one topic. The agenda is shared before the meeting and notes are taken.

We also organize a community call focused on the Foundation for Public Code every third Thursday of the month.

The community call notes are published on our [blog](https://blog.publiccode.net) after the call. Call participants may review the notes before they're published.
