# Post-processing a community call

The notetaker reworks the call notes into a call summary.

The notetaker shares the call summary with people who were on the call for amendment and approval before publishing on the blog.

Depending on what the community call was about and what the conclusions were, update related issues and pull requests [in GitHub](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard) and link to the blog post as an explanation for the update.
