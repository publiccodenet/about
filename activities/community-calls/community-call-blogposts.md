# How to write a community call notes blogpost

Because they happen regularly, blogposts for community call notes have a standard layout.

This guide builds on information in:

* [how to run a community call](../communication/running-community-call.md)
* [how to write a blogpost](../communication/blogging.md)

## At the top of the page

Make sure you:

* format your title like previous community call blogposts
* make sure your title is the same in both the H1 and the frontmatter
* customize your frontmatter excerpt so it's intriguing on the index
* make sure your first sentence summarizes the topics covered

See an [example community call notes blogpost](https://blog.publiccode.net/community%20call/2019/12/11/notes-from-community-call-26-september-2019.html).

## Reworking the notes

We generally tidy the notes for readability and clarity. As we don't promise a verbatim record, use your judgment to:

* reorganize the notes so that the content flows logically for the reader (even if it didn't do so on the call)
* cut out digressions in the conversations, or simply mention that they took place
* reword what people said so that their meaning is clear (especially if it took them some time to discover what they were trying to say)
