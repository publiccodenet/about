# Creating partnerships

The Foundation for Public Code is actively looking for diverse public organizations to collaborate with.

[See our current partnerships](../../organization/partnerships.md).

Only public organizations can become partners.
Other organizations can become [affiliates](../creating-affiliations/index.md)

People interested in becoming partners, or who have questions about partnerships, can email us at <partnerships@publiccode.net>.
