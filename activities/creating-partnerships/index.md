# Creating partnerships

The Foundation for Public Code is a [member-owned association](../member-relations/index.md).
However, membership might not be possible for all organizations that we want to collaborate with.
Collaboration can instead be done through a partnership.

[See our current partnerships](../../organization/partnerships.md).

If you're interested in partnership for your organization, or have any questions, please email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.
