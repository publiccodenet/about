# Creating partnerships

The Foundation for Public Code is actively looking for diverse public organizations to collaborate with.

[See our current partnerships](../../organization/partnerships.md).

If you're interested in partnership for your organization, or have any questions, please email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.
Only public organizations can become partners.
Other organizations can become [affiliates](../creating-affiliations/index.md)
