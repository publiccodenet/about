This group includes people who work directly for public administrations:

* developers
* other people on technology teams with developers, including designers, user researchers, product owners and delivery managers

It also includes people who work for suppliers to public administrations:

* developers
* other people on technology teams with developers, including designers, user researchers, product owners and delivery managers

It also includes:

* other open source contributors
* private companies building new products based on public code

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* sharing development broadens community and lets you tackle bigger problems
* clearer expectations, more buy-in and community norms can help produce better code
* built-in opportunities to learn from other organizations and their experience, leading to better results and services
* new skills and reputations can lead to more professional development opportunities and new markets
* more effective delivery of projects, with:
  * easier and more distributed maintenance
  * a common language and tools for collaboration
  * common training and onboarding

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* black boxes make security impossible
* development is risky, especially if team members leave
* discrepancy between the employment norms and culture of some public administrations and the open source community
* skepticism about government and public administrations' ability to do open source properly at scale
