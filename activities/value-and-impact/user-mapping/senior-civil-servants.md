# Senior civil servants

This group includes senior civil servants at these levels:

* supranational (for example the European Union)
* national
* inter-regional
* membership bodies (for example associations of cities)
* provincial  
* municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* distributing risk of development
* increasing sense of ownership, pride or craft
* enlarging communities of practice and share resources
* facilitating re-approachability/reusability/maintenance
* building trust and security in public services and underlying technology

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* vendor lock-in leads to costly maintenance
* policy changes are impossible to implement in closed, constrained software
* software, contractor or genius employee can suddenly vanish
* there is lack of technological sovereignty (tech dependence)
* it is very hard to find tech talent in the public sector

## Our value proposition for them

We enable:

* easier implementation of policy into technology
* higher quality public services
* more cost-effective implementation, maintenance and upgrading
* more agility for future growth paths
