# How public code supports the Sustainable Development Goals

To illustrate the impact of a healthy public code ecosystem on basis of the United Nation's [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), we contribute towards:

* goal 9, ‘Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure’: by enabling new collaborations between public and private parties
* goal 11, ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’: by enabling sustainable collaboration on digital transformation at scale
* goal 16, ‘Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions’: with transparency, quality public service delivery and participation
* goal 17, ‘Partnerships for the Goals’: by building networks and making tools available
