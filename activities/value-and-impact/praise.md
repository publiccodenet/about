# Praise

This page collects praise we've received for the Foundation's work that we have permission to share publicly.

## The Foundation's role

"The Foundation for Public Code is helping our collaboration of Dutch cities to increase our code quality and making codebases more accessible for others to use."

— Jacco Brouwer, the association of Dutch municipalities (VNG-Realisatie)

## Codebase stewardship

"The codebase stewards helped us in a great way to shift to maintaining our platform code fully in the open. We had two sessions with the stewards, enabling the team to determine the work to be done, then actually making the step to working fully in the open. We now work with more than one team on the codebase on Gitlab."

— Martin Dias d'Ullois, Product Owner, Logius
