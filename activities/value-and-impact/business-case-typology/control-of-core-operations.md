# Improving control of core operations

## Need/problem: 

* Organization with codebase that is critical to core operations and needs to be malleable 

## Value proposition of codebase stewardship: 

* Open source means:
  * Code can be changed to fit changing requirements
  * All functions of the code can be audited for compliance with policy

* Codebase stewardship:
  * Quality
    * Clean documentation helps pin point what part of the codebase does what
  * Community
    * Collaboration around the codebase helps to build trust between the parties and ensures many eyes on the code
  * Support
    * Encouraging a trusted and diverse vendor network improves technological sovereignty 

* This helps to increase control:
  * Increase understanding of what parts of the code do what
  * Increase 'eyes on the code'

## Business case: 

* Strategy to meet essential requirement of control over codeabse

## Strenghts:

* Condusive to government processes, including policy and legal changes 

## Weaknesses:

* Low reuse potential as high granular control makes shared governance harder

## Example:
