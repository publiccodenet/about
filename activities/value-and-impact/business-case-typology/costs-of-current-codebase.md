# Reducing costs of current codebase

## Need/problem: 

* organization with existing high-value codebase that is not being reused or contributed to

## Value proposition of codebase stewardship: 

* Open source means:
  * Code can be reused by others

* Codebase stewardship helps:
  * Community
    * Enable and facilitate the contributions of others, whether maintenance or new features
  * Quality
    * Inspire trust and reliability of the codebase for future reuse
  * Product
    * Marketing raise awareness and encourage reuse by others
  * Support
    * Help to others to implement and procure the codebase, as well as procure new features in a way that contributes back to the codebase 

* This helps reduce the cost as:
  * Other parties reusing the codebase contribute new features based on their usecases that original party can benefit from
  * Other parties relying on the codebase take coownership over maintenance such as security and bug fixes

## Business case: 

* Reduce opex of maintenance and capex of future developments for organization as well as replicating parties

## Strenghts:

* Builds on a high-value proven codebase
* Great sharing narrative/story
* If combined interest of replicators can be pooled, strong business case 

## Weaknesses:

* Requires new capex investment of refactoring and letting go of some governance and control over the codebase
* 'Success' is not our output, but the adoption and investment by other parties
* More direct benefit to replicators than 'organization'- can be unclear who these will be
