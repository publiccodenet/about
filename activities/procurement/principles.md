# Procurement principles and policy

## Procurement principles

To fulfill our mission, we need to be able to be open, reliable, trustworthy, helpful and sustainable.

This means the services and products we use need to be:

* professional
* reliable
* replaceable
* sustainable for the organization as well as society and the planet

The principles of our procurement build on and extend our [cultural values](../../organization/cultural-values.md) and [communication principles](../communication/communication-principles.md).

## Procurement policy

The payment will only be processed if the following requirements have been met:

* Progress report on deliverables signed off by Director or Manager
* Time sheet is up-to-date
* Invoice details are in order
