# Procurement process

This is how we procure all services and some goods.

1. We request a proposal or quote.
2. We check if price and value are in line with the market.
3. We check that the proposed procurement meets our [procurement principles](principles.md).
4. The [operations team](../../organization/staff.md#operations) places the order, or approves the proposal after sign-off by the chief executive and board of directors, if needed.
5. When we procure services of a contractor, we draft a service agreement based on the approved proposal. Both parties need to sign the agreement and ensure adherence to the terms.
6. Depending on the duration, scope and type of assignment (deliverables or hours-based), we also expect time sheets and progress reports with each invoice.
