# Attending events

As an organization which cares about helping people to collaborate there will be plenty of times when that is best done by getting people in the same room to meet face to face. This is a guide that will be useful for anyone who is attending such events. It is by design made as a chronological guide in order to be followed and checked in to over time and divided for different roles.

## General

### Before the event

* Figure out the purpose of attending the event. Which are the goals that the organization is trying to achieve by attending this event? Make sure these are aligned with the overarching [mission, founding principles and goals](../../organization/mission.md). The goals will usually determine who is representing the organization at the event. Think of how, after the event, you will measure or determine if these goals are accomplished.
* Appoint someone who is responsible for this particular event. Even though responsibilities might be delegated, it helps to be clear on who has authority to make decisions. This also reduces the risk that a task might be left undone.
* Take in consideration that if the event is large, being at least two attending can be crucial to cover all the things that are important for the goals to be met.
* Create internal awareness. In order to enable synergies, sharing the overall plans with the rest of the organization is important.
* Check the agenda, if someone happens to be connected to any of the speakers, consider reaching out.
* Consider bringing the printed version of the Standard for Public Code or other informational material we have to give away to people that want to get to know us better.

### During the event

* Be ready to take pictures. They can be used for tweets, blog posts or for remembering what happened when debriefing.

### After the event

* Upload photos to some storage solution.
* If just one person attended the event, do at least a debrief at the daily standup and offer to venture deeper with anyone who may be interested.
* If two people attended the event, sit down for a short debrief with each other.
* If three or more people attended the event, consider doing a [retrospective](../staff-meetings/retrospective-agenda.md).
* Evalute if the goals set for the event were met.
* Process all expenses for the event.

## Communications

### Before the event

* As a team, agree publicly shareable goals for your attendance at the event that can be used as elevator pitches and calls to action in communications (in addition to any private goals).
* Draft generic tweets for each session the team will attend.
* Draft clever, thoughtful tweets to support any presentations we give.

### During the event

* Tweet the URL of any HackMD running notes document so we create crowdsourced event notes in English.
* Ask the team to share good photos on the group chat.
* Tweet at least once per session - follow the generic tweet with specific comments crafted during the session.

### After the event

* Publish a blogpost promptly (based on good photos, running notes, team debrief and tweets).
