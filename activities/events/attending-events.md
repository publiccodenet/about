# Attending events

Sometimes the best way to help people collaborate is by getting them in the same room to meet face to face.
This guide for Foundation for Public Code staff attending events is designed to be followed chronologically.
There are additional tasks for communications specialists.

Before using this guide, make sure to [get a decision on attending the event](deciding-to-attend-events.md).

## For everyone

### Before the event

* Appoint someone who is responsible for this particular event. Even though responsibilities may be delegated, it helps to be clear on who has authority to make decisions. This also reduces the risk that a task might be left undone.
* Create internal awareness. In order to enable synergies, sharing the overall plans with the rest of the organization is important.
* Check the agenda. If someone happens to be connected to any of the speakers, consider reaching out.
* Consider bringing informational material to give away to people that want to get to know us better.
* Consider using a shared document to do the planning in, perhaps using [this template](events-planning-template.md).

### During the event

* Be ready to take photos. They can be used for tweets, blog posts or for remembering what happened when debriefing.
* Take photos of any business cards you receive.

### After the event

* Upload photos.
* If just one person attended the event, debrief at the daily standup and offer to venture deeper with anyone who may be interested.
* If two people attended the event, sit down for a short debrief with each other.
* If three or more people attended the event, consider doing a [retrospective](../staff-meetings/retrospective.md).
* Process all expenses for the event.
* Process all new contacts for the event.
* Evaluate if the goals set for the event were met.

## For communications specialists

### Before

* As a team, agree publicly shareable goals for your attendance at the event that can be used as elevator pitches and calls to action in communications (in addition to any private goals).
* Draft generic tweets for each session the team will attend.
* Draft clever, thoughtful tweets to support any presentations we give.

### During

* Tweet the URL of any HackMD running notes document so we create crowdsourced event notes in English. Do not include secret notes in the document.
* Ask the team to share any good photos they take.
* Tweet at least once per session - follow the generic tweet with specific comments crafted during the session.

### After

* [Publish a blogpost](https://github.com/publiccodenet/blog) promptly (based on good photos, running notes, team debrief and tweets).
