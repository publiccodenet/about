# Codebase stewardship assessment

In assessment we evaluate whether a codebase can be [incubated in codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/lifecycle.md).

Guides:

* [How we do assessments in the open](open-assessment.md)
* [How to create a new assessment spreadsheet for a codebase](create-assessment-spreadsheet.md)

Resources:

* [Assessing existing codebases](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md)
* [Template for assessment issues](assessment-issue-template.md)
