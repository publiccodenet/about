# Governance game

The governance game is an interactive game on governance of [Public Code](../../../glossary/public-code-definition.md) intended to be used as a way to get a conversation and reflection about governance started. We aim to use it during [early incubation of a codebase](../../codebase-stewardship/product-assets-for-early-incubation.md) and in external [workshops](../index.md) to highlight the complexities of governance.

## Workshops

* [How to run a workshop](run-governance-game-workshop.md)
* [Workshop session proposal](session-proposal.md) - to send to conference organizers and similar

## Repository

The repository for the game can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game). There you can download cards to print them yourself or suggest improvements.
