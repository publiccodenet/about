# Governance game workshop session proposal

This is a proposal for doing a workshop with the governance game at an external event like a conference or similar.

## Session title

Governance track: Interactive game exploring how public organizations can maintain shared and collaborative open source software together.

## Session description

Dodging calamity while managing code contributions from multiple vendors and agreeing on new features to co-finance - which card will you play next?

## Target audience

Anyone who is interested in governance of collaboratively developed software. It works best with a group of people with mixed backgrounds and experiences including at least one developer and one civil servant.

## Requirements

* A room large enough to fit all participants around a table.
* 2-6 participants.
* A table that participants can stand around and all interact with cards that are being put on the table.

### Optional

The workshop can also be held with two groups at the same time if the room is large enough so that they can stand around a table each and not crowd each other. If so, the number of participants can be doubled (and the room needs to be bigger).

## Time

We suggest a 40-45 minute time slot. The game itself can be played in 30 minutes, whereas the remaining time is used for reflection of how it played out.
