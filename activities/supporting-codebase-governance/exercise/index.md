# Governance exercise

The governance exercise is designed to help civil servants develop a shared understanding and vocabulary of how to make open source projects successful in a government organization. It focuses on the governance of open source software, as well as the main opportunities, risks, mitigation strategies and scenarios encountered when beginning or implementing an open source project. It is best done with a mix of developers, development managers, open data specialists, policy makers and procurement managers.
