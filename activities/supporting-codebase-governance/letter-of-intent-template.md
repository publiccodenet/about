# Letter of Intent Template

This is a template that can be used for a letter of intent from an organization that wants to join a codebase community.
Before deciding to use a letter of intent, decide what you want this to achieve.

In general, having a letter of intent from each participating organization is powerful since each commitment is public.
This means that the new organizations that wants to join can see what level of commitment exists in the community.
That builds trust and a more appropriate level of expectation can be set.
It can also invoke a feeling of having to contribute on a certain level which both have advantages and disadvantages.
The benefit is that a new contributing organization may make sure to make resources available when they join, but it might also scare some off.

The letter of intent can also be used in the `GOVERNANCE` as the minimum limit to be able to join a product steering committee.
The limit can even be set to include a minimum commitment.
If you want a minimal version, the paragraph about budget can be skipped.
Skipping it makes it weaker, but it has the advantage that it can be easier to sign off on.
