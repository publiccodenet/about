# Technical Roadmap Template

This is a template that can be used for technical roadmaps, it's based on a version that [Sharetribe used](https://github.com/sharetribe/sharetribe/blob/a029d02ab3b60009ebb6faff54117ba1034a6bfc/TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md).

## Overview

This document sheds light on the current development plans of the team.
Plans change constantly as new information comes to light.
Thus, this document represents **a snapshot of our plans at this point in time**, based on the information that is currently available.

In other words, the purpose of this document is to share the current state of the team's understanding.

To reiterate: the plans shared in this document should not be considered set in stone.
They will change when relevant information is absorbed by the team.
