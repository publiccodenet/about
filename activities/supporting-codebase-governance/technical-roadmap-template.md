# Technical Roadmap Template

This is a template that can be used for technical roadmaps, it's based on a version that [Sharetribe used](https://github.com/sharetribe/sharetribe/blob/a029d02ab3b60009ebb6faff54117ba1034a6bfc/TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md).

## Overview

This document sheds light on the current development plans of the team.
Plans change constantly as new information comes to light.
Thus, this document represents **a snapshot of our plans at this point in time**, based on the information that is currently available.

In other words, the purpose of this document is to share the current state of the team's understanding.

To reiterate: the plans shared in this document should not be considered set in stone.
They will change when relevant information is absorbed by the team.

## What is currently being worked on

*Add a heading for everything is currently worked on here. Follow that heading with why you're working on that. Optionally you can also describe the how and what.*

## Themes that will likely be worked on next

These are the plans that currently feel like the best options for what the team should work on next.
Improvements listed below might come out in a month, a year, or (unfortunately) never â€” it all depends what the team learns along the way.

*Add a heading for everything that is likely to be worked on in the future here. Follow that heading with why you're working on that. Optionally you can also describe the how and what.*
