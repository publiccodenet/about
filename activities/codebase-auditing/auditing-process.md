# The auditing process

The audit happens completely in the version control platform and is designed to fit in to a regular agile software development process.
When a contribution is presented for inclusion in the codebase, a Foundation for Public Code staff auditor familiar with the codebase will provide a review or certify the contribution.

The review or certification will happen within 2 business days to enable agile development and not block users and maintainers from making progress.

The codebase maintainers will be notified when a contribution passes the audit and is certified.

## Template

As a help to review a codebase, [this template](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard/blob/develop/docs/review-template.html) can be used.

## List of assessments

For any codebase where there is not yet an explicit agreement to publish an assessment, or one in progress, add the link to the assessment to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wUrlZ73S-4BK3sGz87C28d0ReYELCCP4MZnKpB0UKqM/edit#gid=2105222073) (only accessible for staff).
