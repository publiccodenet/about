# Codebase auditing

% The Foundation for Public Code will only start auditing codebases in summer 2019. %

We perform audits on [codebases](../../glossary/codebase.md) – including source code, policy, documentation and conversations therein – as well as individual contribution to that codebase in order to guarantee that they are compliant with the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) and the standards set out in the codebase itself.

The audit performed by auditors of the Foundation for Public Code is meant to complement machine testing. Auditors test for whether documentation is actually understandable and attached, the commit messages make sense, community-oriented guidelines are being followed and other factors that cannot be machine tested.

Certification by the Foundation for Public Code on suggested contributions can provide trust to maintainers trust when deciding whether to incorporate them.

## The auditing process

The audit happens completely in the version control platform and is designed to fit in to a regular agile software development process. When a contribution is presented for inclusion in the codebase, a Foundation for Public Code staff auditor familiar with the codebase will provide a review or certify the contribution.

The review or certification will happen within 2 business days to enable agile development and not block users and maintainers from making progress.

The codebase maintainers will be notified when a contribution passes the audit and is certified.

## Public code codebase and contribution certifications

If an individual contribution to a codebase passes the audit, that contribution is certified. If every contribution to a codebase has been certified – or the entire codebase has passed and been certified as one contribution – the codebase is certified.

If the public code audit process is added to a codebase farther along in its development, new merge requests can be certified but the existing code cannot be. By auditing every contribution the codebase can move towards being completely certified. For the codebase to be completely certified every meaningful line of code, and the commits behind the code, need to meet the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/).
