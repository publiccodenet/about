# Codebase auditing

We perform audits on [codebases](../../glossary/codebase-definition.md) – including source code, policy, documentation and conversations therein – as well as individual contributions to that codebase in order to guarantee that they are compliant with:

* the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)
* the standards set out in the codebase itself

The audit performed by auditors of the Foundation for Public Code is meant to complement machine testing. Auditors test for whether documentation is actually understandable and attached, the commit messages make sense, community-oriented guidelines are being followed and other factors that cannot be machine tested.

Certification by the Foundation for Public Code on suggested contributions can provide reassurance to maintainers when deciding whether to incorporate them.
