# Codebase Auditing

We perform audits on [codebases](../../glossary/codebase.md) – including source code, policy, documentation and conversations therein – as well as individual contribution to that codebase in order to guarantee that they are compliant with the standards set out by the Foundation For Public Code and the standards set out in the codebase itself.

The audit performed by auditors of the Foundation For Public Code is meant to complement machine testing. Auditors test for whether documentation is actually understandable and attached, the commit messages make sense, community-oriented guidelines are being followed and other factors that cannot be machine tested.

Certification by the Foundation For Public Code on suggested contributions can provide trust to maintainers trust when deciding whether to incorporate them.

## The auditing process

The audit happens completely in the version control platform and is designed to fit in to an regular Agile software developement process. When a contribution gets presented for inclusion in to the codebase a Foundation For Public Code staff auditor that knows the codebase will provide a review or certify the contribution. 

The review and/or certification will happen within 2 business days to enable Agile development and not prevent users and maintainers from advancing.

If a contribution passes and is certified the audit the codebase maintainers will be informed.

## Public Code codebase and contribution certifications

If an individual contribution to a codebase passes the audit that contribution is certified. If every contribution to a codebase has been certified – or the entire codebase has passed and been certified as one contribution – the codebase is certified.

If the Public Code audit process is added to a codebase farther along in its development new merge requests can be certified, however, the existing code cannot be certified. By auditing every contribution the codebase can move towards being completely certified. For the codebase to be completely certified every meaningful line of code, and the commits behind the code, need to be up to the standards.
