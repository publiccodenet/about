Activities are things we do.

## Naming an activity

An activity should always be named as something we perform, for example:

* Codebase stewardship
* Training
* Recruitment
* Ice-cream distribution
* Cat petting

## Adding an activity

Add a folder with an index and the necessary resources.

Be sure to link your new activity from the index.
