# When sick

If you are feeling sick you might not be able to perform your work, or even worse jeopardise the stability of the organization.
When sick you might make important mistakes or you can be contagious and cause more staff absence.

Foundation for Public Code staff are always paid while sick (100% the first year of sickness and 70% the second year).
Of course we will work together to support your return to work as soon as possible, in accordance with the law ([Wet Verbetering Poortwachter](https://www.arboportaal.nl/onderwerpen/wet-verbetering-poortwachter)) and in collaboration with the occupational health and safety service ([arbo-dienst](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbodienst)) contracted by the Foundation.

## Can you go to work

If you feel sick then do not go to the office.

If you feel well enough to work, but there is a chance others might get sick from contact with you, work from home.

If for any reason you do not feel that you can perform your work at your usual abilities, it is important you recognise this and find work that is safe for you to do. You can discuss this with your manager.

## Call in sick

On the first day of sickness you need to let us know you are sick before 9am. You can do so by mailing <hr@publiccode.net>.
This is also true on a day you were planning to work from home or on a day you have booked as vacation.

The operations coordinator (or your manager) will inform your colleagues so that they can plan accordingly.

## Returning to work

Let <hr@publiccode.net> know when you resume your regular work.

Please do this the afternoon before you plan to come back to work. Or when you are well again, even if the next day is not a work day for you.

You can always check in again the next day if you were too optimistic (and need to stay home a bit longer).

Alternatively, email the morning (when you resume work), at the latest.

This is important as the operations coordinator needs to end the notification of your sickness in the HR portal.
This enables us to know you are back in and avoids action by the arbo-dienst.

## Sick leave management

The operations coordinator immediately reports the sick leave in [the portal of our absenteeism insurance](https://mijnwerkgeversportaal.acumen.nl/index3.html).
As soon as the employee is better it needs to be reported in the same portal. This can also be done retroactively if the operations coordinator is not present on the day the employee goes back to work.

### Long-term sick leave management

In case an employee is sick for a longer time the ARBO doctor will be involved. Our ARBO service is [RegioPoortwachters](https://www.regiopoortwachters.nl/). A case manager from RegioPoortwachters will reach out to inquire about the sick employee within approx. 10 days after the initial sickness report in the insurance portal. The ARBO service portal is integrated with our insurance portal.

A meeting with an ARBO doctor will be planned to assess the situation of the employee. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, reintegration will be initialized when the situation allows. [A reintegration plan (plan van aanpak) will be drafted for employees who get ill](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/working-conditions-employees/). This plan should include the procedures all involved parties must follow. The director must approve the plan.

### Reintegration management

The case manager is the main contact person between the sick employee and the director. Updates are send regularly. It's important that the percentage of sickness vs reintegration hours are tracked in the insurance portal. E.g. if an employee is working 20% this means they are sick for 80%. This needs to be kept up-to-date as the insurance pay-out is based on the percentage of sickness.

After a certain amount of time, approx. 1.5 months after the initial sickness report, the insurance company will request payslips of the sick employee to prepare for the insurance pay-out. The director will receive a mail about this. [The payslips are available for admins in Tentoo](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/tool-management/tentoo.html).

### UWV (Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen)

If the employee has been sick for more than three quarters of a year, [it must be reported to the UWV](https://www.uwv.nl/werkgevers/werknemer-is-ziek/loondoorbetaling/werknemer-is-langdurig-ziek/index.aspx) no later than the first working day after the 42nd week of illness: the 42nd week report. Once that has been done we will receive a letter about the (first year) evaluation. During this evaluation the director and the employee discuss whether the approach has been successful. The ARBO case manager will be available for guidance and instructions when this moment comes.
