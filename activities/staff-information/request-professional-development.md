# Professional Development

Staff at the Foundation for Public Code is responsible for their professional development and growth.
This means that staff needs to invest both in time and effort, such as courses, as a part of their job.
This guide explains what you need to do in order to engage in learning opportunities.

Professional development is fully paid for by the organization, both in time and learning costs,
if the board of directors agrees it is worth investing in.
If the board of directors believes that the course only partially serves the mission of the organization it can decide to offer to pay for part.

Requesting a learning opportunity happens by sending an email to the board of directors at <directors@publiccode.net> answering the following questions:

1. What is the exact course you’d like to follow or investment you’d like to make?
1. What are the costs involved in money and time investment?
1. How do you think this will help you and the organisation, what is the return on investment?

With this information the board of directors can make a decision on the investment in the following board meeting,
after which it will let you know what it has decided.
