# Collaboration on codebases and components at scale

## Diagram

![graphical representation of a codebase with a large set of contributors](codebases-scale.svg)

## Points to get across

* Multiple organizations can share the same component
* Multiple organizations can have components based on the same codebase
* Multiple organizations can contribute to, and improve on, the same codebase
* Any organization can change their own components without affecting the codebase or another organization's components
* Changes to components can later be contributed back to the original codebase
* These organizations can include public organizations, private sector companies and individual contributors
* Open source is the way to enable collaborating at scale with the least friction
