# Activities

## Product Stewardship

We help public source code & policy code products be successful by guaranteeing their marketability and quality. Trustworthy, usable, maintained and sustainable code for your city.

We provide the following for products, projects and codebases in our care:

* IP management, product stewardship
* Code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Productization services: branding, communication, refactoring for reuse
* Community management: processing feedback and contributions, events
* Packaging, distributing official versions, compatibility updating
* Marketing, communications, public relations
* Developer advocacy, user support, end-user success, training materials
* Project infrastructure, process management

We provide these services only at _ecosystem level_.
This means that we make sure that code is reusable across contexts globally.
For local implementations we collaborate with local implementation partners, working actively with them to both integrate effectively in the local context while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement as well.
