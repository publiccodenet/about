# Activities

These are all of the activities, products and services of the Foundation for Public Code that serve to further the [mission](../organization/mission.md) to serve our members directly:

* [Codebase stewardship](codebase-stewardship/index.md): Providing for the sustainability, marketability and assured quality of a public code product.
* [Codebase auditing](codebase-auditing/index.md): Certifying contributions and codebases as public code.

These are the processes and services that make our operations work:

* [Documentation of the organization](documentation/index.md)
* [Member relations](member/index.md)
