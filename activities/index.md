# Activities

## Product Stewardship

We help public source code & policy code products be successful by guaranteeing their marketability and quality. Trustworthy, usable, maintained and sustainable code & code for your city.

We provide the following for products, projects and codebases in our care:

* IP management, product stewardship
* Code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Productization services: branding, communication, refactoring for reuse
* Community management: processing feedback and contributions, events
* Packaging, distributing official versions, compatibility updating
* Marketing, communications, public relations
* Developer advocacy, user support, end-user success, training materials
* Project infrastructure, process management

### Making collaboration across contexts possible

We provide these services explicitly at _ecosystem level_ – not at a national or city level – to make sure that context specific code or policy does not become a barrier to implementation.
This means that we make sure that code is reusable across contexts globally.

For local implementations we collaborate with local implementation partners, working actively with them to both integrate effectively in the local context while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement as well.

### Providing long term product sustainability

One of the biggest barriers to uptake of Open Source code & code is the unpredictable nature of maintainers.

Products in the care of the Foundation For Public Code have long term sustainability so that prospective users can trust there will be packages when they need to update their systems and that there will be someone to receive their Pull Request after the original maintainers have moved on.

We provide this sustainability in the first place by creating strong communities of users and developers that can take ownership over the product.

### Giving you the agility you need

Product stewardship is not someting you can stick onto a product after you have developed it, it is a continuous process. The Foundation For Public Code is agile and works asynchronous to help Pull Requests be merged, and Issues to be resolved sooner.

We test for code and documentation quality as well as security issues in every Pull Request to a shared `develop` or `release` branch to make sure that problems can be spotted as quickly as possible and to guarantee that little to no technical debt has been created. This enables a faster collaborative development and easier publication of releases.
