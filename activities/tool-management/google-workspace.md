# Google Workspace

Google Workspace, formerly known as G Suite, is a collection of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products developed and marketed by Google. We use Google Workspace for email, calendaring and internal document management.

## Using Google Workspace

Staff are issued a Google Workspace account when they join.
Google publishes [extensive support documentation](https://support.google.com/).

## Google Workspace management

Google Workspace (user) administration is managed by the operations coordinator. The operations coordinator as well as the chief executive have full adminstrative privileges. The operations coordinator is responsible for user management. She ensures proper on-boarding and off-boarding policies are in place and enforced. She also creates and manages groups, aliases, domain management and 3rd party app integrations.

## Privacy and GDPR

Google's [introduction to Google Cloud & the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/) says that Google Workspace relies on model contracts:

> "We contractually commit under our current data processing agreements to maintain a mechanism that facilitates transfers of personal data outside of the EU as required by the GDPR. Googleâ€™s certification under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks includes Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform. We have also gained confirmation of compliance from European Data Protection Authorities for our model contract clauses, affirming that our contractual commitments for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform fully meet the requirements to legally frame transfers of personal data from the EU to the rest of the world."
