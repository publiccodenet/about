# Tool management and guidance

The Foundation for Public Code needs tools to accomplish its mission. This is how we manage our tools:

* [Tool and email naming conventions](tool-and-email-naming-conventions.md)
* [How to test a tool](tool-testing.md)

## Tool overview

* [For chat we use Mattermost, the open source alternative for Slack](mattermost.md)
* [Odoo Community for CRM and project management](odoo.md)
* [We manage contracts using Docusign.](docusign.md)
* [G Suite is used for email, calendaring and internal document management.](g-suite.md)
