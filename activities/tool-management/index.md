# Tool management and guidance

The Foundation for Public Code needs tools to accomplish its mission. This is how we manage our tools:

* [Tool and email naming conventions](tool-and-email-naming-conventions.md)
* [How to test a tool](tool-testing.md)

## Tool guidance

This guidance covers:

* instructions for users
* how we manage the tool internally
* the tool's privacy and GDPR policies

Our current tools are:

* [1password](1password.md) (password management)
* [Docusign](docusign.md) (contract management)
* [GitHub](github.md) (version control and codebase management)
* [Google Workspace](google-workspace.md) (email, calendaring and internal document management)
* [Jitsi Meet](jitsi-meet.md) (videoconferencing)
* [Mailman](mailing-lists.md) (mailing lists with Hyperkitty archiver)
* [Mattermost](mattermost.md) (chat)
* [Odoo Community](odoo.md) (CRM and project management)
* [Podbean](podbean.md) (publishing our podcasts)
* [Streamyard](streamyard.md) (livestreaming our podcast)
* [Tentoo](tentoo.md) (human resources management, including processing salaries and expenses)
* [Voys](voys.md) (VoIP)
