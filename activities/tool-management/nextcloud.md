Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. Nextcloud is free and open source. We are currenty using Nextcloud for file sharing with our community and the general public.

## Using Nextcloud

Staff are issued a Nextcloud account when they join. Nextcloud publishes [extensive support documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/).

## Nextcloud management

Nextcloud (user) administration is managed by the Operations Coordinator. The Operations Coordinator as well as the Chief Executive have full adminstrative privileges. The Operations Coordinator is responsible for user and folder management, customization, making sure Nextcloud stays up-to-date and ensuring proper onboarding and offboarding policies are in place and enforced.

Tweaks in the Nextcloud configuration can be made after SSHing into the machine as root:

`cipmas@nextcloud-publiccode:/var/www/nextcloud/nextcloud/config$ sudo nano config.php`

* use `cd` to change directories
* use `ls -l` to see whatâ€™s in the directory
* use `grep -i` command to find specific things, such as trusted domains, which was needed to add subdomains making sure Nextcloud can be reached at e.g. 'files.publiccode.net' as well
