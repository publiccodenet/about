# Tool and email naming conventions

The Foundation for public Code relies on email and tools to accomplish its mission. We've established these conventions for how our email and toolnames are structured so that:

* we can easily name new tools or create email addresses in a way that won't create conflicts for other uses or users
* people using our tools clearly understand what tool they're interacting with (and its purpose)
* our tools and email addresses are predictable

## Principles

Tool names should be a description of the tool's function, not its brand name. This makes sure:

* we can change the specific provider without needing to change the URL
* the URL makes sense even if someone isn't familiar with that brand
* the provider can expand their product offering or rename their brand without it affecting us

Every email address should be:

* self-explanatory
* unambiguous
* fail privately not publicly (eg if you start to type and your email client auto-completes the wrong email address, you won't send a very private email to a big group)

## Existing tools with an email address

These tools have their own URL and associated email:

* client relationship management: odoo.publiccode.net (Odoo)
* forum: discuss.publiccode.net (Discourse)
* video calling: meet.publiccode.net (Jitsi)

Q: are there existing list conventions for "all-codebasename@lists.publiccode.net (all-signalen@lists.publiccode.net) or subgroup-codebase@"? If so, we should follow those.
