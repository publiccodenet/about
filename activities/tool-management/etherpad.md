# Etherpad

We have an Etherpad lite running at [write.publiccode.net](https://write.publiccode.net/).

### What to do with people's data

A user can provide their name or a pseudonym as author. All authorships can be cleared from the current version but it will still be shown in the Timeslider functionality. 

### How we handle code of conduct violations

By default, the full [Foundation for Public Code code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all of our pads.

## Etherpad management

The Etherpad is hosted on a VPS at [Maadix](https://maadix.net/en), an independent service provider.
