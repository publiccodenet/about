# Payment session

On a regular basis we'd like to pay all bills and things we need to.
This session is meant to get all of those tasks done.

Ideally this session is done timely so all the salaries can be paid before the end of the month.
This session requires that the salaries are processed by our salary administration, which is requested after the [salary run preparation session](salary-session.md) is done and a notification of this has been sent.

Tasks:

1. Make payment orders for:
   * Outstanding invoices that were sent to the [invoices email group](https://groups.google.com/a/publiccode.net/g/invoices).
   * Payment orders for the [salaries `SEPA` file and the wage taxes](salary-administration.md).
2. Send the payment orders, and if required ask someone with signing permissions to sign them.

After the payment session has been done, [the bookkeeping of them](bookkeeping.md#invoices--payable) can be started.
