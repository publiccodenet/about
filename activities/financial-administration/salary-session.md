# Salary session

Every month we need to pay all of our staff salaries, in this session we file whatever is needed in order to be able to pay.

This session is necessary to run the [payment session](payment-session.md) as that requires the salary run to be completed. For this reason it needs to happen before that one.

Tasks:

1. Approve, ask for clarification or disapprove expense requests pending from the [Tentoo NMBRS dashboard](https://tentoo.nmbrs.nl) in the 'Mutuation Forms Approver'.
1. Request the salary run from the dashboard. With the request provide a message of all changes that have to with the salary run such as people leaving, unpaid leave etcetera.
