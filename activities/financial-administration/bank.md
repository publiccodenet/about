# Bank

Our bank is the Rabobank. There is a EUR checking and savings account. We are in the process of opening a USD account. There are bank cards, credit cards and online keys.

These people have bank access:

* The chief executive, operations coordinator, and treasurer have an online key for internet banking
* The chief executive has a debit card (wereldpas) and credit card
* The operations coordinator is authorized to make € 5000 payments without a co-sign
* The chief executive’s daily limit is € 50,000 and can be temporarily raised if needed by calling the bank
