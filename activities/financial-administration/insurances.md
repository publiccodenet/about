# Insurances

We work with insurance intermediary [Zicht Adviseurs](https://www.zichtadviseurs.nl/zakelijk) for all our insurances. Contract renewals and invoices are both sent by snail mail or via email and saved in a physical folder in the desk cabinet underneath the chief executive's desk.

We have the following insurances:

* Corporate liability
* Board insurance
* Travel insurance for team
* Absenteeism insurance (sickness)
* Inventory insurance (office furniture), which includes fire insurance

Detailed overview of insurances and terms can be found [on our secret drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xbO--Pjr5CFDKTbaFiMS8A_SpEAIS06A).
