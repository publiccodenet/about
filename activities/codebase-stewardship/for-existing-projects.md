# Codebase stewardship for existing projects

Codebase stewardship can be provided to an existing codebase.
In that case, there might be some important considerations about how to transition and budget for that.

Before entering the [codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md) all potential codebases are evaluated according to our [criteria for codebase stewardship](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md).

## What developing organizations need to do

The developing organization needs to commit developer time and budget to:

* make their contributions compliant with the standard
* make their contributions, as well as the entire project, reusable by others
* partake in the community to further the development and help others reuse the codebase

We also need the developing organization to give us:

* support in product marketing and access to other organizations to enable reuse
* organizational knowledge on procurement and technology to help others reuse the codebase

## How we support developing organizations

We will:

* conduct [audits](../codebase-auditing/index.md) to help comply with the standard on every pull request
* provide training and workshops to develop better reusable codebases as well as working with the community
* run community events and calls to integrate a community
* connect relevant members of this or other communities to increase uptake and contributions
* develop storytelling and marketing of the project based on best practices and research
* provide prospective reusers and contributors with a helpdesk to answer their questions on issues ranging from installations to procurement
* help create budgets and frame costs
