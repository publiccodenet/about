# Codebase stewardship for existing projects

Codebase stewardship can be provided to a codebase after it has already been developed.
In that case there might be some important considerations about how to transition and budget for that.

Before entering the [codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md) all potential codebases are evaluated according to our [criteria for codebase stewardship](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md).

## What developing organizations need to do

The developing organization needs to commit developer time and budget to:

* make their contributions compliant with the standard
* make their contributions, as well as the entire project, reusable by others
* partake in the community to further development and help others reuse the codebase

We also need the developing organization to give us:

* support in product marketing and access to other organizations in order to enable reuse
* organizational knowledge on procurement and technology to help others reuse the codebase

## How we support developing organizations

We will:

* conduct [audits](../codebase-auditing/index.md) to help comply with the standard on every pull request
* provide training and workshops to develop better reusable codebases as well as working with the community
* run community events and calls to integrate a community
* connect relevant members of this or other communities in order to increase uptake and contributions
* develop storytelling and marketing of the project based on best practices and research
* provide prospective reusers and contributors with a helpdesk to answer their questions on issues ranging from installations to procurement
* help create budgets and frame costs
