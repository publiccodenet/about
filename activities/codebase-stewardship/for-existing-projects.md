# Codebase stewardship for existing projects

Here we explain what organisations that want a existing project to be in [codebase stewardship](index.md) have to do and what we will do to support them in this process.

## What developing organisations need to do

What we need from the developing organisation:

* Time and budget from developers to:
    * Make their contributions compliant with the standard.
    * Make their contributions, as well as the entire project, reusable by others.
    * Partake in the community in order to further development and help others reuse the codebase.
* Support in product marketing, access to other organisations in order to enable reuse.
* Organisational knowledge on procurement and technology to help others reuse the codebase.

## What we do

Support we will provide:

* Conduct [audits](../codebase-auditing/index.md) to help comply with the standard on every pull request.
* Provide training and workshops to develop better reusable codebases as well as working with the community.
* Run community events and calls to integrate a community.
* Connect relevant members of this or other communities in order to increase uptake and contributions.
* Storytelling and marketing of the project based on best practices and research.
* Provide prospective reusers and contributors with a helpdesk to answer their questions on issues ranging from installations to procurement.
* Help create budgets and frame costs.
