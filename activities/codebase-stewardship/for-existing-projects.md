# Codebase stewardship for existing projects

This explains:

* what organizations that want a existing project to be in [codebase stewardship](index.md) have to do
* what we do to support them in this process

## What developing organizations need to do

The developing organization needs to commit developer time and budget to:

* make their contributions compliant with the standard
* make their contributions, as well as the entire project, reusable by others
* partake in the community to further development and help others reuse the codebase

We also need the developing organization to give us:

* support in product marketing and access to other organizations in order to enable reuse
* organizational knowledge on procurement and technology to help others reuse the codebase

## How we support developing organizations

We will:

* conduct [audits](../codebase-auditing/index.md) to help comply with the standard on every pull request
* provide training and workshops to develop better reusable codebases as well as working with the community
* run community events and calls to integrate a community
* connect relevant members of this or other communities in order to increase uptake and contributions
* develop storytelling and marketing of the project based on best practices and research
* provide prospective reusers and contributors with a helpdesk to answer their questions on issues ranging from installations to procurement
* help create budgets and frame costs
