# User personas

In order to understand better the behavior and aspirations of our community, we've developed this *personas* template folder.
In user-centered design and marketing, a persona or user persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type.
Our community members have important needs and frustrations that must be kept in mind when developing a resource for them.

Once again, every persona represented here describes the behavior of a hypothesized contributor of our community.

The aim of this set of templates is to be used by public code professionals.

User personas templates:

* [Project manager at a municipality. Civil servant](project-manager-municipality.md)
* [Project manager at an association of public entities. Civil servant](project-manager-association.md)
* [Communication manager at an association of public entities. Civil servant](communications-manager.md)
* [Policy maker. Civil servant](policy-maker-officer.md)
* [Vendor. Owner of a small software development company](vendor-owner-developer.md)
