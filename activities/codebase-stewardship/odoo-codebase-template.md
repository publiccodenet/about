# Odoo codebase template

This is a template that can be copy-pasted into Odoo for a new codebase to give it a basic structure to fill in. The template is meant to be added on the tab "Description" on the task for the codebase. If information is missing in the table, add the reason for it so your colleagues know why and that it is clear that it was just not forgotten.
