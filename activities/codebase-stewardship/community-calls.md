# Community calls

## What is a community call?
To enable different kinds of knowledge sharing, we organize a video call every two weeks. The call goes on for about an hour and usually focuses on one topic. The agenda is shared before the meeting and notes are taken. After the community call, a cleaned up version of the notes is sent out for participants to check and is then published on our blog.
