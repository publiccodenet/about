# Community calls

To enable different kinds of knowledge sharing, we organize a video call every two weeks. The call goes on for about an hour and usually focuses on one topic. The agenda is shared before the meeting and notes are taken.

The community call notes are published on our blog after the call. Call participants may review the notes before they're published.
