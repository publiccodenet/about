# Codebase stewardship

Through codebase stewardship we help public source code and policy code products become [successful](success-for-a-codebase.md) in being collaboratively developed and maintained at scale, reused widely and sustainable.
We can provide codebase stewardship from the beginning of the development or for [existing projects](for-existing-projects.md).
