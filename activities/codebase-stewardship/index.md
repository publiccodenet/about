# Codebase stewardship

Through codebase stewardship we help public source code and policy code products become [successful](success-for-a-codebase.md) in being collaboratively developed and maintained at scale, reused widely and sustainable.
We can provide codebase stewardship from the beginning of the development or for [existing projects](for-existing-projects.md).

How codebase stewardship works:

* [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md)
* [the codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md)
* [how codebase stewardship works for existing projects](for-existing-projects.md)
* [stewardship assesment criteria for existing codebases](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md)

Activities performed in codebase stewardship, split into four domains:

* Community stewardship
  * Community management: processing feedback and contributions, events
* Product marketing stewardship
  * Productization services: branding, communication, refactoring for reuse
  * Marketing, communications, public relations
* Quality stewardship
  * [Codebase auditing](../codebase-auditing/index.md): code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Support stewardship
  * Developer advocacy, user support, end-user success, training materials
  * Packaging, distributing official versions, compatibility updating
  * Operations: project infrastructure, process management
  * Legal services: intellectual property management, trademark protection
