# Codebase stewardship

Through codebase stewardship we help public source code and policy code products become [successful](success-for-a-codebase.md) in being collaboratively developed and maintained at scale, reused widely and sustainable.
We can provide codebase stewardship from the beginning of the development or for [existing projects](for-existing-projects.md).

How codebase stewardship works:

* [the codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md)
* [how codebase stewardship works for existing projects](for-existing-projects.md)
* [stewardship assesment criteria for existing codebases](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md)

Activities performed in codebase stewardship split into four domains:

* Community stewardship
  * Community management: processing feedback and contributions, events
* Product marketing stewardship
  * Productization services: branding, communication, refactoring for reuse
  * Marketing, communications, public relations
* Quality stewardship
  * [Codebase auditing](../codebase-auditing/index.md): code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* Support stewardship
  * Developer advocacy, user support, end-user success, training materials
  * Packaging, distributing official versions, compatibility updating
  * Operations: project infrastructure, process management
  * Legal services: intellectual property management, trademark protection

## Making collaboration across contexts possible

We provide these activities explicitly at _ecosystem level_ – not at a national or city level – to make sure that context specific code or policy does not become a barrier to implementation.
This means that we make sure that code is reusable across contexts globally.

For local implementations we collaborate with local implementation partners, working actively with them to both integrate effectively in the local context while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement as well.

## Providing long term product sustainability

One of the biggest barriers to uptake of open source code is the unpredictable nature of maintainers.

Products in the care of the Foundation for Public Code have long term sustainability so that prospective users can trust there will be packages when they need to update their systems and that there will be someone to receive their pull request after the original maintainers have moved on.

We provide this sustainability in the first place by creating strong communities of users and developers that can take ownership of the product.
