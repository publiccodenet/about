# Codebase stewardship

Through codebase stewardship, we help public source code and policy code products become [successful](success-for-a-codebase.md).
We help codebases be:

* collaboratively developed
* maintained at scale
* reused widely and sustainable

We can provide codebase stewardship from the beginning of the development or for [existing projects](for-existing-projects.md).

## What codebase stewardship is

* [activities we perform in codebase stewardship](activities.md)
* [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md)
