# Evaluation criteria for codebase stewardship

These are the evaluation criteria the staff of the Foundation for Public Code use to help evaluate whether a codebase is ready and suitable for incubation. They are used before and after the 'Assess' phase in the [codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md).

## Evaluation criteria

* Business case: what is the business case for the codebase becoming public code and being reused?
* Co-develop-ability: does the codebase lend itself to collaborative development?
* Community: does the codebase have an active and engaged community?
* Community potential: is there a strong potential for the community to grow beyond its existing members?
* Code reusability: is the code written in a way that makes it easy to be reused?
* Reuse potential: to what extent can the codebase be reused, both in a different context or for a different purpose?
* Societal impact: what is the potential societal impact of the codebase becoming public code and being reused?
* Story: what is the story-telling and communication value of this codebase becoming public code and being reused?  

## Evaluation questions

The current owners of potential codebases are asked to answer these questions to help us better understand their codebase.

### Business case

1. What's the current budget committed?

### Co-develop-ability

1. What percentage of codebase covered by tests?
2. Can developers run the tests on their laptop?
3. What are the buildtime and runtime dependencies?
4. How many modules does the codebase have?
5. How many lines of code does the codebase have?
6. Is there a diagram and description of the system architecture?
7. What portion of the APIs are documented?
8. What portion of the code is commented/has inline documentation?
9. What portion of the documentation exists in English?
10. Are there any proprietary dependencies?
11. Are there written engineering guidelines to inform architectural and code structure decisions?
12. Are there explicit style guidelines for how code should look?

### Community

1. What portion of contributors are staff, contractors/freelancer, 3rd party procurement/vendors or volunteer?
2. How many contributors have contributed in the last 6 months?
3. What is the average number of commits per week in 2019?
4. How many organizations contribute to this codebase?
5. Which of these does your community have for discussion among users: email at a specific addres, email list, forum, bugtracking system, other (write in)?
6. Which of these does your community have for discussion among developers: email at a specific addres, email list, forum, bugtracking system, other (write in)?
7. Do you have contributor guidelines to help new people contribute?
8. Does the community currently use English?
9. What other languages does your community use?

### Community potential

1. Is there a 2 to 4 year roadmap?
2. Is there a public backlog in English or one you can make public?
3. How far through your current set of goals are you?
4. How realistic vs ambitious are your goals in the next 6 months?
5. Is there a public bugtracking system in English or one you can make public?
6. Is the codebase being deployed by another organization?
7. Has any other organization expressed an interest in deploying the code?

### Code reusability

1. How long would it take a team of 2 devs to extract to make the code configurable such that it could be deployed for a different org?
2. What languages are used in your project?

### Reuse potential

1. What portion of the codebase is only understood by 1 or 2 people?
2. Is the relevant policy bundled with the code?
3. Can the relevant policy be bundled with the code in English?
