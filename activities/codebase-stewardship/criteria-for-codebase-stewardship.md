# Criteria  for codebase stewardship

These are the criteria for codebase stewardship used before and after the 'Assess' phase in the codebase stewardship lifecycle. They help evaluate whether a codebase is ready to be incubated. They are in no particular order of importance.

* Community
   * Does the codebase have an active and engaged community?
* Community potential
   * Is there a strong potential for the community to grow beyond its existing members?
* Code reusability
   * Is the code written in a way that makes it easy to be reused? 
* Co-develop-ability
   * Does the codebase lend itself to collaborative development?
* Reuse potential
   * To what extent can the codebase be reused, both in a different context and/or for a different purpose?
* Societal impact 
   * What is the potential societal impact of the codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?
* Business case(s)
   * What is/are the business case(s) for the codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?
* Story
  * What is the story-telling and communication value of this codebase becoming Public Code and being reused?
