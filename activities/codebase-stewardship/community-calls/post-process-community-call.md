# Post-processing a community call

The notetaker reworks the call notes into a call summary.

The notetaker shares the call summary with people who were on the call for amendment and approval before [publishing on the blog](../../communication/community-call-blogposts.md).

Depending on what the community call was about and what the conclusions were, update related issues and pull requests [in GitHub](https://github.com/publiccodenet/standard) and link to the blog post as an explanation for the update.
