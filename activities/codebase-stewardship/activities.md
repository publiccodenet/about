## We represent the codebase

## Only at ecosystem level

We perform the activities in codebase stewardship exclusively on the [ecosystem level](../../glossary/ecosystem-level-definition.md) as we are there to get the codebase the largest possible uptake.
We intentionally do not work on a local level or a tied to a specific legal context as it is our responsibility to keep the code reusable and the community inclusive.
