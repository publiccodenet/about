## We represent the codebase

We work to further the [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md).
We represent the future of the codebase and community.
We do not work to serve the needs of community members individually.
We serve the needs of the community as a whole.

## Only at the ecosystem level

Our role in the development and community of a codebase is to maximize reuse.
We perform the activities in codebase stewardship exclusively at the [ecosystem level](../../glossary/ecosystem-level-definition.md).
We intentionally do not work on a local level or a tied to a specific legal context as it is our responsibility to keep the code reusable and the community inclusive.
