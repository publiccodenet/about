![graphical representation of incoming contributions to a codebase](codebase-quality.svg)

## Points to get across

* help ensure the quality of the codebase, including the code, tests and documentation
* can include checks on all code currently in the codebase
* can include checks on all new contributions to the codebase, such as new elements created for individual components that others might want to use
