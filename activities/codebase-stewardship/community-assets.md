# Community assets

This is a checklist of the most important community assets needed to put an existing codebase on its path to incubation, roughly organized by when they're needed.

## Assumptions

We assume that the chronological goals during incubation are to:

* make sure the codebase is deliberately designed and documented to be reusable
* create everything needed to enable and support a contributing community
* focus on collecting evidence and marketing to attract more replicators and contributors
* improve an active codebase based on performance metrics, user research or new feature requests

We assume each codebase will have different individual needs.

We assume the community asset order will be different for greenfield development.

## Assumptions to test

This list is based on our experience from working with several codebases.

These include that:

* making clear which responsibilities the Foundation for Public Code has versus other parties is useful
* which other party is responsible differs by codebase
* for some codebases, multiple parties share responsibility for non-Foundation for Public Code tasks (for example, a codebase's current maintainers and a replicator working together)
* the size of each task depends on codebase size and complexity
* this list can be used as a checklist or plan of work during incubation
* it would be helpful to add user needs, user stories or jobs to be done to the list items (as we discussed user needs when we created the list)
