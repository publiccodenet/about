# Running a Standard for Public Code community call

## 1. Opening the call

Call-in link: <https://meet.google.com/tfd-acmn-tkb>

Agenda link: <https://hackmd.io/-OegeqvoThCbAsw3c3gIjw>

Have each person join the call on a separate connection aligned with our [conference call etiquette](../communication/conference-call-etiquette.md).

### No show

If nobody joins at the call starting time, wait at least 15 minutes before closing the call. If possible, leave the call open the entire hour for potential late drop-ins.

### Introduction round

The chair:

* welcomes everyone to the Standard for Public Code community call on behalf of the Foundation for Public Code
* briefly mentions what is on the agenda for today (without being so specific that discussions start)
* notes that the call will be minuted, but not recorded, and the minutes published on our blog. Everyone on the call will get the chance to review and fix the minutes before they're published
* asks everyone to introduce themselves - who are you, do you represent an organization, what's your interest in public code or the topic for this call?
* starts with themselves
* asks someone else to go next (for example, someone they know to be excited about the topic, or a friend of the Foundation, or an extrovert)
* keeps track of who's introduced themselves and nudges anyone who hasn't by the end

The notetaker keeps track on who participated on the call.

### Short update from the Foundation for Public Code

The chair:

* thanks everyone for introducing themselves
* asks if everyone's familiar with the Foundation
* gives optional introduction to the Foundation for Public Code
* gives update since the last community call (from the notes document)

#### Optional introduction to the Foundation for Public Code

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-driven, member-funded and member-governed association of public organizations.

We work to enable open and collaborative public-purpose software for public organizations internationally.

The Foundation for Public Code supports software at the codebase level through codebase stewardship and by publishing the Standard for Public Code.

## 2. Substance of the call

The chair explains:

* the substantive agenda
* any timekeeping plans (to manage expectations - is this a free form or strict agenda?)

The chair then either:

* hands over to the (first) substantive expert
* facilitates discussion of the substantive agenda themselves

The notetaker takes notes in as much details as possible. More is better than less, and will be cleaned up during the [post-process](../community-calls/post-process-community-call.md).

## 3. Closing the call

When either the time is up, or all topics have been exhausted, the chair:

* asks if anyone has anything else to add or ask before closing the call
* reminds everyone that there is another call in a month and asks for suggested topics for that call
* explains that the minutes will be sent out for review
* thanks everyone for participating in the call
