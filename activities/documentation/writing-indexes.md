# How to write an index

Every topic/folder in the about has an index file named `index.md`. The goal of this file is to:

* Explain what this topic is about
* What resources and guides are available on this topic

## Anatomy of an index page

### Metadata

An index markdown file always starts with the following [`front-matter`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```markdown
---
type: Index
---
```

### Name of the topic

```markdown

# Tea making and curation

```

### Explanation of the topic and context

The index should give a high level explanation of the topic. It should provide enough context for someone to act on the guides and resources related to this topic.

### Resources and guides

This section lists the resources and guides that are available under this topic or in this folder.
