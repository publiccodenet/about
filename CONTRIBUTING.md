# Contributor Guide 🙇‍

The Foundation For Public Code has [a mission to develop an Open Source ecosystem for cities](mission.md). In order to fulfill our mission we – the directors of the Foundation, our advisors and contributors – need your help!

This repository serves as the 'official source of truth' about the Foundation For Public Code. It contains all of its documentation, procedures and information as well as explanations on what the Foundation For Public Code does. We see it a bit like a 'living' charter.

In this guide we try to set out all the ways you can contribute to the Foundation For Public Code.

## How you can help


### Advise and discuss to help us solve issues

Please look at [the list of Issues marked 'Help Wanted'](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/labels/help%20wanted), these are all of the issues (and proposed changes to content) where we feel we need help.

All of the issues that we're working on and prioritising are on the [Kanban Board for this project](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/projects/1).

For instance you could give us feedback on this guide, the [README](README.md) or any other file in this repository.

Resolving these issues is a community effort as well, so be sure to clearly describe what you mean as others might not have the same context that you have.
