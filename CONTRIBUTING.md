# Join us

Thanks for your interest in the Foundation for Public Code! We’re excited to meet you.

There’s lots of work going on as we start the Foundation - we’d love your help with this.

In 2019 we’re focused on:

+ designing and testing our codebase stewardship processes
+ establishing relationships with the Foundation’s founding members (public organizations)

We plan to scale in 2020.

In the meantime, please join us in any way you can.

## Team member

Our [roles page](https://about.publiccode.net/roles/) has an overview of our current job openings. If you are the person fitting one of these roles, or you know of someone who might, we'd love to hear from you.

## Individual contributor

Our [contributor guide for individuals](contributor-guides/for-individuals.md) explains how to find out what we’re currently working on and what we’re looking for help with.

We’re especially interested in learning what you need to implement the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) in your organization. Please [raise an issue](http://standard.publiccode.net/CONTRIBUTING.html) or email us at <info@publiccode.net>.

## Public organization

We’re currently looking for innovative public organizations to [join us as founding members](http://publiccode.net/membership/founding-membership). As a founding member, you’ll have the chance to shape the Foundation’s processes and governance. Your code will be among the first accepted for Foundation stewardship.

Come lead our community of enterprising public organizations using public code to power their digital transformations.

## Institutional giving and philanthropy

If you believe there should be a structural solution to making open source software viable at scale for public organizations, we’d love to hear from you. Email us at <giving@publiccode.net>.
