# Staff code of conduct

Staff of the Foundation for Public Code fulfills a crucial role in achieving our mission on behalf of our members, the wider community, and the public benefit.

As the Foundation for Public Code is a non-partisan organization that operates in sectors of the economy that have significant political interests it is crucial that the organization as well as its staff are visibly independent, impartial, and objective.

## Comply with the community code of conduct

Staff are expected to follow the general [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to our community. The code of conduct is effectively a part of this staff code of conduct.

## Conflicts of interest

Any personal interest or any interest in any business or organisation that could compromise the respect of these obligations must be declared immediately.

Outside activities covered by these rules, paid or unpaid, must first be approved. Staff members must also inform their manager if:

* their spouse is employed and where; or
* a personal interest that might impair their independence or any other conflict of interest occurs, in the course of performance of their duties.

## Receiving gifts

Members of the Foundation for Public Code staff may not accept gifts, payment, or favours from any non-member organizations, individuals, or third parties without obtaining prior permission.

As an exception a gift can be accepted without prior approval when:

* there is a cultural, social or diplomatic obligation to accept the gift,
* the value of the gift does not exceed €50,
* and there is no accumulation.

If hospitality is included in the participation of a mission, conference, workshop or other meeting that has been approved it will not require separate approval.

## Language

Use English for all communication between staff.
Minimize the use of jargon and avoid abbreviations and acronyms.

## Secret information

While strive to be an open and transparent organization whenever possible there are always communications that are sensitive.
If any communication should never end up with the general public it must be marked as secret.
Maintaining a clear distinction between what can be and what can not shared be is essential for running an organization that aims to be as open as possible.

All secret communication must be marked with the word '**Secret**' and clearly state:

* who made it secret, the **owner**;
* who may view it, the **access**;
* and why it is secret, the **reason**.

The owner – and their superiors – are responsible to update or remove the secret classification when needed.

## Security

All secret communication must be marked with the word 'secret' and state:

* Who made it secret, the owner
* Who may view it, the viewers
* Why it is secret, the reason
