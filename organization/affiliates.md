# Affiliates

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-owned association that exists in an ecosystem of affiliates and [partners](partnerships.md).
Affiliates are non-profit organizations whose work aligns with ours and that help us to [achieve our mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html).
The Foundation for Public Code does not do work to benefit affiliates unless that work is for the direct benefit of public organizations.

These are our affiliates:

* [Associaci√≥ de Software Lliure Decidim](https://decidim.org) (Decidim Free Software Association)
* [Dark Matter Labs](https://darkmatterlabs.org/)
* [OASC](https://oascities.org/)
