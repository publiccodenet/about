6.2.    The membership ends:

* a.    in the case of a founder:

### Article 7: Membership dues

7.1.    Founders do not owe any membership dues.

7.2.    Every public member has to pay annual membership dues.

The annual membership dues payable by a public member for a given financial year of the association shall be agreed between the board of directors and that public member no later than 1 December in the financial year preceding the financial year to which the membership dues relate. The board of directors and a public member can also agree on the membership dues for several financial years.

The valuation of these in-kind contributions will take place in mutual consultation between the board of directors and the relevant member prior to the financial year to which the membership dues relate. The agreed upon value of the in-kind contribution counts as fully paid membership dues for that financial year in determining that member's number of general assembly votes, as set out in article 12.4.

7.6.    If the membership ends during the financial year, the annual membership dues for that year remain payable in full.

7.7.    The board of directors keeps an overview of the agreed and actually received membership dues in the association’s membership register.

### Article 8: Organization

The association has the following bodies: the general assembly, the board of directors and the advisory board.

### Article 9: General assembly

All powers within the association lie with the general assembly, except those assigned to other bodies either by law or by these bylaws.

### Article 10: Convening of the general assembly, meeting location

10.1.    The general assembly meets at least once a year, within six (6) months of the end of the financial year, and additionally as often as deemed necessary by the board of directors.

10.2.    The board of directors is obliged to convene the general assembly if (a) member(s) with combined voting rights of at least one-tenth (1/10th) of the total votes request this in writing, stating the subjects to be discussed.

If the board of directors does not comply with a request from the member or members referred to above within fourteen (14) days, so that the meeting is held within four (4) weeks of the request, the requesters are authorised to convene the meeting themselves with due observance of the provisions of these articles of association. The requesters may then entrust persons other than the board of directors with managing the meeting and preparing the minutes.

10.3.    The general assembly must be convened with at least three (3) weeks’ notice. The board of directors convenes the meeting in writing, stating the location, time and subjects to be discussed.

10.4.    Meetings of the general assembly are held in a location designated by the board of directors. This location can be either in the Netherlands or abroad.

### Article 11: Access to the general assembly

11.1.    Each member has access to general assembly meetings, at which every public member who wishes to participate in the meeting must appoint a member of their governing body, their secretary, their registrar or other official working for them as the representative who will represent the public member at the meeting.

At the start of the meeting, each representative of a public member shall submit (in a manner to be determined by the board of directors) a written statement indicating their power of attorney to represent the public member.

11.2.    In addition to the members, the meeting can also be accessed by directors, advisory board members and anyone admitted by the chairman of the meeting. They may also speak in the meeting.

11.3.    Members may also participate in the deliberations of the general assembly through electronic communication channels. The board of directors may impose conditions on the use of electronic communication channels. These conditions may relate to participation in the deliberations and voting. The board of directors will announce any conditions in the notice convening the meeting.

11.4.    The chairman of the board of directors also acts as such at general assembly meetings. If the chairman of the board of directors is not present, the meeting shall appoint its own chairman.

11.5.    Minutes of the meeting proceedings shall be kept by the secretary of the board of directors or, if the secretary is not present, by a person designated for that purpose by the chairman. These minutes shall be adopted at the same or at the next meeting and, as proof thereof, shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary of that meeting.

### Article 12: Decision making and voting

12.1. All resolutions shall be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, except those for which another majority or other quorum is required by law or by these articles of association.

12.2.    A member may grant another member or a director a written proxy to cast their vote(s). A member may act as a proxy for no more than one (1) other member.

12.3.    Each founder has one (1) vote in the general assembly.

12.4.    The number of votes that a public member has in the general assembly depends on the membership dues that they actually paid to the association in the financial year in which they exercise their voting rights in the general assembly (the "annual membership dues paid"). This number of votes is calculated by raising the amount of the annual membership dues paid to the power of seven tenths and dividing the result by one thousand (the annual membership dues paid^0.7/1,000), whereby the result of this formula is rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The annual membership dues paid, as shown in the membership register updated up to and including five working days prior to the meeting at which the voting right is exercised, are decisive for determining the number of votes a public member has in the general assembly, with the proviso that membership dues which, contrary to the provisions of article 7.4, have not been paid before 1 January of the financial year in question will not be taken into account for determining the annual membership dues paid. The membership dues actually paid by a public member who joined during the financial year in question in accordance with the provisions of article 7.5, shall be fully taken into account in determining the annual membership dues paid.

Each director has a consultative vote at the general assembly.

12.5.    In the event of a tied vote, the proposal shall be rejected.

If the votes are tied when electing a person, then lots shall be drawn. If no one gets an absolute majority in an election between more than two (2) persons, the vote shall be rerun between the two (2) persons who received the largest number of votes.

12.6.    The ruling expressed by the chairman at the meeting on the result of a vote is decisive. The same applies to the content of a decision taken when a vote was taken on a proposal that was not recorded in writing. However, if the correctness of the chairman's ruling is disputed immediately after it has been pronounced, a new vote will be taken if the majority of the meeting desires it. The legal consequences of the original vote lapse as a result of this new vote.

12.7.     Members may exercise their voting rights by electronic communication channels, provided that the member or their representative can be identified on the electronic communication channel, can follow the meetings proceedings in real time and can exercise their voting rights.

12.8.    A unanimous written decision of everyone entitled to vote at the meeting, even without a meeting taking place, has the same force as a general assembly resolution, provided it takes place with the prior knowledge of the board of directors.

### Article 13: Board of directors

13.1.    The board is responsible for the management of the association.

13.2.    Each director is obliged by the association to properly perform their duties. Each director is responsible for the general affairs of the association.

With due observance of the current policy plan, the board is authorised to decide to enter into agreements to acquire, dispose of and encumber registered property and to enter into agreements whereby the association undertakes to act as guarantor or enter into a debt jointly and severally, to act on behalf of a third party or to provide security for the debt of a third party.

13.4.     In all cases where the association has a conflict of interest with one or more directors, the general assembly may appoint one or more persons to represent the association. A director is obliged to inform the general assembly and his fellow directors of a conflict of interest.

### Article 14: Composition and appointment

14.4.    Directors are appointed for a period of four (4) years, unless otherwise decided upon at the time of appointment. A retiring director may be reappointed at any time.

* a.    by his death;
* b.    by resigning voluntarily;
* c.    by the end of the term for which he has been appointed, on the understanding that this director will remain in office until his successor has been provided for;
* d.    because the director no longer meets the conditions set at the time of his appointment;
* e.    by dismissal by the general assembly; or
* f.    if he is placed under guardianship.

### Article 17: Absence or inability to act

17.1. In the event of the absence or inability to act of a managing director, the remaining managing directors, or the only remaining managing director, are temporarily in charge of the entire management of the association. In the absence or inability to act of all managing directors, the association shall be temporarily managed by the person designated for that purpose by the general assembly.

* d.     the director is missing or suspected of having died.

17.3.    Members of the board of directors who are unable to take part will not be taken into account when determining to which extent members of the board of directors are present or represented, agreeing on a method of decision-making, or the number of votes they can cast.

If no resolution is reached because the votes are tied, a second board meeting shall be convened, to be held within fifteen (15) days of the first, at which the proposal in question shall be raised again. If no resolution is reached on the proposal in question at this second board meeting because the votes are tied, the proposal will be rejected.

21.3. All votes are taken orally unless the chairman, or (in the case of the election of persons) a person with voting rights who is present, requires a written vote, in which case the vote shall be taken by means of unsigned, closed ballot papers.
