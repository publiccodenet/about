# Financing model for the Foundation for Public Code

This conceptual model helps founding members shape the Foundation's financial model.

## Overview

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-owned association. Its mission is to enable public-purpose software and policy that is open and collaborative.

This means we are primarily member-funded, with additional support from grants, subsidies and philanthropic donations.

Our funding is used for codebase stewardship and to support the public code ecosystem.

Examples of things we pay for are: codebase stewards' and support staff salaries, travel to work with members, hosting and attending conferences and events, office expenses, and associated materials like the Standard for Public Code.

## Membership dues: facts

To achieve our mission, our operations prioritize long term sustainability for the benefit of our members. This means all core operations should be covered by membership dues.

Membership dues:

* can vary between members
* determine voting rights in the general assembly
* can be paid in money, in kind or a combination of both
* can change from year to year
* are paid yearly

More information can be found in the [governance model](governance-model.md) and [articles of association](articles-of-association.md).

## Membership dues: open discussion points

The founding members are currently working on:

* how to define the appropriate and proportional rate of dues for each member
* what in-kind contributions can be made instead of cash, and how to value these
* what financial governance and documentation do members require for their internal budgeting and auditing processes

## Grants, subsidies and philanthropic donations

As our focus is on long term sustainability, our financial model should not rely on grants, subsidies or philanthropic donations.
