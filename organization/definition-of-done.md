# Definition of done

In all of our projects we use the following definition of done. This means we say something is done only when it:

1. fulfills its goals
2. is peer reviewed
3. is tested for project standards
4. is ready to deploy
5. fits in and is connected to its context
6. the history is documented
7. is documented for use and further development

If you cannot get your work to done easily consider breaking your work up in multiple issues that can all have their goal fulfilled.
