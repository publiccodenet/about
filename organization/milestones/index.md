# Milestones

We use milestones to plan our work around and set priorities. Milestones replace what other organisations would call 'projects' by focussing on the key achievements over certain deliverables.

Milestones have an owner and can have a due date.

## How to use milestones

Milestones can be used in GitHub. They can be added to issues as well as pull requests which makes it easier to find and version things.

In our office we have a wall with the milestones on it.
