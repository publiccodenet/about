# Milestones

We use milestones to plan our work around and set priorities. Milestones replace what other organisations would call 'projects' by focussing on the key achievements over certain deliverables.

Everyone in the organization works to accomplish these milestones.

Upcoming milestones:

* First committed member
* First committed member from another country
* First committed member from a different kind of organization
* Secure budget with committed resources
* Assessment started for every committed member
* Assessment done
* First codebase in incubation

[See our past milestones](past-milestones.md).

## How to use milestones

Milestones can be used in GitHub. They can be added to issues as well as pull requests which makes it easier to find and version things.

In our office we have a wall with the milestones on it.

## How to add a milestone

1. Add a milestone to the GitHub repository where possible
    * Mention the owner in the description
    * Set the due date if available
2. Add the milestone to the list above
    * Add an owner
    * Add a due date if available
    * Link to the repository milestone
3. Update the milestone wall in the office
