# Staff and contractors

The staff of the Foundation for Public Code Vereniging are employees that execute the work agreed on by the [general assembly](../organization/governance-model.md#general-assembly) under direction of the [board of directors](../organization/governance-model.md#board-of-directors).

Some roles in our organization are fulfilled by contractors. For transparency, these are mentioned with the legal entity they bill through.

As we are a community leadership organization that mostly helps others, we aim for minimal hierarchy and overhead and maximal autonomy for the specialists who further [our mission](mission.md).

The staff consists of a manager, [a coordination team](#coordination-team) and specialists.
