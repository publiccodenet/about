# Governance model for the Foundation for Public Code

This provides a non-legal summary of the Foundation's governance model as established in the [articles of association](articles-of-association.md).

## Overview

The Foundation for Public Code is a [non-profit association (vereniging) under Dutch law](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/choosing-a-business-structure/association/).

The association's members are the regional Foundation for Public Code chapter organizations.
These members are responsible for and steer the association's operations, including priorities and annual budget for the organization.

## Foundation bodies

The Foundation consists of five bodies:

* general assembly
* board of directors
* strategic council
* advisory board
* staff

### General assembly

All members are represented in the general assembly.

The general assembly:

* approves the Foundation's operational plan for the coming year
* elects the board of directors

These decisions are agreed through a majority vote.
Each member has 3 votes.
This ensures democratic ownership and control by all members.
Additionally, the members of the strategic council each have 1 vote (see below).

The general assembly meets at least once every year.
Minutes from the general assembly meetings are shared with all members and [publicly archived](general-assemblies/index.md).

We commit to holding all meaningful votes electronically, so that all members can be represented regardless of ability to attend physically.

### Board of directors

The board of directors is elected by the general assembly.
By law, the responsibilities include that of the chair, secretary and treasurer.
The general assembly can add responsibilities and define how they are divided into roles within the board of directors.

The board of directors proposes the Foundation's policy plan, operational plan and budgeting for the coming year.
These decisions are agreed upon through majority vote.

The board of directors meets regularly and is required to keep the general assembly informed about its activities.
Minutes are [publicly archived](board-of-directors-meetings/index.md).

The current board members are:

* Ben Cerveny (Chair)
* Richard Pope

### Strategic council

The [strategic council](strategic-council.md) helps the board of directors with key strategic decisions and serve as ambassadors for our mission.

### Advisory board

The advisory board members are experts that support the general assembly, board of directors and staff.
There are some decisions for which they must be consulted

### Staff

The [staff of the Foundation for Public Code](staff.md) carry out the Foundation's day to day work.

The staff are responsible for:

* [codebase stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/), including codebase auditing
* maintaining the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net)
* administering the Foundation, including organizing community events and financial administration
