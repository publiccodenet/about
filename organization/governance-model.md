# Governance model for the Foundation for Public Code

This provides a non-legal summary of the Foundation's governance model as established in the association bylaws.

## Overview 

The Foundation for Public Code is a [member-owned association (vereniging) under Dutch law](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/choosing-a-business-structure/association/). Only wholly publicly owned organizations may become members.

This means members are responsible for and steer the Foundation's operations, including priorities and annual budget for the organization.

## Foundation bodies

The Foundation consists of four bodies:
* general assembly
* committee
* advisory board
* secretariat 

### General assembly

All members are represented in the general assembly. 

The general assembly: 
* approves the Foundation's operational plan for the coming year
* elects the committee

These decisions are agreed through a majority vote. Voting rights are proportional to members' membership dues. This ensures democratic ownership and control by all members.

The general assembly meets at least once every year. Minutes from the general assembly meetings are shared with all members.

We commit to holding all meaningful votes electronically, so that all members can be represented regardless of ability to attend physically.

### Committee

The committee is elected by the general assembly. By law, it must include a chair, a secretary and a treasurer. The general assembly can vote to add more roles to the committee.

The committee:
* proposes the Foundation's operational plan and budgeting for the coming year
* approves membership applications

These decisions are agreed upon through majority vote.

The committee meets regularly and is required to keep the general assembly informed about its activities.

### Advisory board

The advisory board is a set of experts that suppport the general assembly, committee and the secretariat. There are some decisions for which they must be consulted.

### Secretariat

The secretariat is the staff of the Foundation for Public Code. They carry out the Foundation's day to day work.

The secretariat is responsible for:
* [codebase stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/), including codebase auditing 
* maintaining the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net)
* administering the Foundation, including organizing member events and financial administration
