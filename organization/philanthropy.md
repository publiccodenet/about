# Philanthropy policy

The Foundation for Public Code is currently wholly financially supported by philanthropists who share our commitment to [our mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html). To prevent undue influence, all donations are unearmarked and go into our general operating budget, in compliance with our status as a Dutch [public benefit organization (ANBI)](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/business-public-benefit-organisations/public_benefit_organisations/public_benefit_organisations).

We will be philanthropically funded until we have enough members paying dues to support a sustainable blended financial model.

[See our financial model](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/financial-model.html) for more information about our long term financial plans.

## Working together with philanthropists

We value the experience, expertise and connections of the philanthropists who've chosen to support us.

Our donors have helped us scale, grow internationally and communicate for impact.

Philanthropists are not involved in our prioritization of activities or day to day operations.

[See our governance model](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/governance-model.html) for more information about how the Foundation is governed.
