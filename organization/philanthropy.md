# Philanthropy policy

The Foundation for Public Code is currently wholly financially supported by philanthropists who share our commitment to [our mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html). To prevent undue influence, all donations are unearmarked and go into our general operating budget, in compliance with our status as a Dutch [public benefit organization (ANBI)](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/business-public-benefit-organisations/public_benefit_organisations/public_benefit_organisations).

In the future, we aim for the Foundation for Public Code to be primarily member-funded, with additional philanthropic support. Membership dues should cover core stewardship operations and member relations to make sure weâ€™re sustainable in the long term. We hope to use philanthropic gifts for awareness raising, ecosystem growth, training and toolset improvement.

[See our financial model](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/financial-model.html) for more information about our long term financial plans.

## Working together with philanthropists

We value the experience, expertise and connections of the philanthropists who've chosen to support us.

Our donors have helped us scale, grow internationally and communicate for impact.

Philanthropists are not involved in our prioritization of activities or day to day operations.
