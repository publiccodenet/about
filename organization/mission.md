# Mission of the Foundation for Public Code

We create a viable future for cities and civic operating systems that are highly participatory and drive societal engagement. A public digital infrastructure that is inclusive, (re-)usable, adaptive, open and sustainable.

To achieve this we maintain, manage, contribute to and grow an ecosystem of public software and policies that help governments, communities and citizens improve their cities.
