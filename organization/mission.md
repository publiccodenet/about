The founding principles were adopted by the board of directors on 23 August 2019.

\* In order to start as an association, 4 individual founders will play the role of member until there are enough public members for the organization to sustain itself.

## Current priorities

The current priorities of the organization are set
by the [board of directors](governance-model.md)
and reviewed every meeting.

On 29 April 2020,
the priorities were set as:

1. Members: get public organizations to join the association
1. Codebases: get codebases into stewardship
1. Funding: secure funding for the next years

In order to achieve these priorities, we have come up with a number of [outcomes and measurable goals](measurable-goals.md) for the period December 2020 - March 2021.
