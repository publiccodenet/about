# General Assembly minutes, 10th July 2023

## Present

* Ben Cerveny, Founder, Chairman, and Member, Foundation for Public Code
* Ivonne Jansen-Dings, representing Member Provincie Zuid-Holland

## Agenda

The Foundation for Public Code will transform from member-based to a chapter-based Vereniging or Stichting with Amsterdam HQ, and numerous chapters globally, starting with the North American chapter, already forming.
The umbrella organization will maintain ANBI status.

Provincie Zuid-Holland would cease to become a member as soon as the Foundation legally begins the process of transforming from its member-based form to chapter-based form, within the next months.
However, Provincie Zuid-Holland will be invited immediately to become a Partner organization, which is how the Foundation for Public Code will be working with public administrations going forward.
This will be provisional until we provide a formal document that can be presented to and accepted by the legislature in Zuid-Holland.

## Approval

* Ben Cerveny, Founder, Chairman, and Member, Foundation for Public Code
* Ivonne Jansen-Dings, representing Member Provincie Zuid-Holland
