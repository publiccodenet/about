# Remuneration policy

This explains the Foundation for Public Code's approach to remuneration.

## Staff, contractors and interns

Foundation salaries are competitive as well as in line with the social mission of the organization.

The Foundation will reimburse reasonable expenses for staff, contractors and interns.

## Board of directors

Members of the Board of directors are not paid for their work as directors. A director may separately be hired and paid by the Foundation for work carried out in a different role (for example, Chief Executive Officer). The Foundation will reimburse directors for expenses incurred as a result of their role as director of the Foundation.

## Volunteers

Volunteers are not paid for their work for the Foundation. We will reimburse reasonable expenses.

## Definition of reasonable expenses

We reimburse reasonable expenses incurred while working for the Foundation for everyone who works with us.

We consider reasonable expenses to be:

* costs incurred while working towards the [Foundation's mission](mission.md)
* public transport costs incurred during business trips: flights (economy class only), train (2nd class only), bus or other local public transport, [OV bike](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets) or taxis
* private transport used for business trips: kilometers logged in private vehicles ( cars, motorcycles or bicycles) for business trips
