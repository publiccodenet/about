# Remuneration policy

This explains the Foundation for Public Code vereniging's approach to remuneration. Our policy is that remuneration in the organization will not exceed market rates.

## Staff, contractors and interns

Salaries are competitive as well as in line with the social mission of the organization.

The Foundation for Public Code will reimburse reasonable expenses for staff, contractors and interns.

## Board of directors

Members of the Board of directors are not paid for their work as directors. A director may separately be hired and paid by the Foundation for Public Code for work carried out in a different role (for example as a manager or contractor). The Foundation for Public Code will reimburse directors for expenses incurred as a result of their role as director.

## Volunteers

Volunteers are not paid for their work for the Foundation for Public Code. We will reimburse reasonable expenses.
