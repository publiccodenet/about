# Remuneration policy

This explains the Foundation for Public Code's approach to remuneration.

## Staff, contractors and interns

Foundation staff salaries are competitive as well as in line with the social mission of the organization.

> Interns may or may not be compensated, depending on whether they're part of a work placement scheme or have an external stipend. We believe strongly that everyone who works for us should receive a living wage. (FACTCHECK?)

The Foundation will reimburse reasonable expenses for staff, contractors and interns.

## Board of directors

Members of the Board of directors are not paid for their work as directors. The Foundation will reimburse directors for expenses incurred as a result of their role as director of the Foundation.

## Volunteers

Volunteers are not paid for their work for the Foundation. We will reimburse reasonable expenses.

## Definition of reasonable expenses

We reimburse reasonable expenses [incurred while working for the Foundation] OR [while carrying out work authorised by the Foundation] for everyone who works with us.

We consider reasonable expenses to be:
- costs incurred while working towards the [Foundation's mission] (voorgeschoten uitgaven voor het realiseren van het doel van de stichting)
- public transport incurred during business trips: flights (economy class only), train (2nd class only), bus or other local public transport, [OV bike](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets) or taxis
- private transport used for business trips: gereden kilometers in private vehicles (eg cars, motorcycles or bicycles) for business trips
