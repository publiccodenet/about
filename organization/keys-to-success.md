# Keys to success

* A concise and clearly formulated definition of public code encompassing both a culture of collaboration and a technical certification
* A 'trust machine' that reassures public organizations and inspires developers to participate, including a well communicated value proposition and brand
* A mission-driven team working with [a set of well documented, open processes](../activities) and communicating effectively with external stakeholders
* A [governance model](governance-model.md) that establishes the public ownership of the association and provides steering mechanisms that ensure priority of the public interest
* An [open culture](cultural-values.md) that both is as transparent as possible and as open to collaboration as possible
