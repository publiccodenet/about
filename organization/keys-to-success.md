# Keys to success

* A concise and clearly formulated definition of Public Code encompassing both a culture of collaboration and a technical certification
* A 'trust machine' that reassures municipalities and inspires developers to participate, including a well communicated value proposition and brand
* A mission-driven team working with a set of well documented, open processes and communicating effectively with external stakeholders
* A governance model that establishes the public ownership of the foundation and provides steering mechanisms that ensure priority of the public interest
* An open culture that both is as transparent as possible and as open to collaboration as possible
