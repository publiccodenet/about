# Privacy

The Foundation strongly supports individuals' right to privacy. For this reason we don't have an analytics package that tracks individual users on any of our websites.

We keep contact details for:

* people who have signed up to get our news
* people we work with
* staff and interns

The bases for processing this information are respectively consent, legitimate interest and to fulfill a contract.

## What personal information we collect from you

For people who have signed up to get our news, we collect:

* name
* email address
* job title if applicable
* organization if applicable

For people we work with, we collect:

* name
* contact details: email address, physical adddress or phone number
* job title if applicable
* organization if applicable

For staff and interns, we collect:

* name
* job title
* date of birth
* contact details: email address, physical adddress and phone number
* bank details to pay salaries
* health information to manage sickness absence if applicable

## What we do with your personal information

We use it to send people information about our news and events.

We use it to work directly with people to carry out the work of the Foundation.

We use it to efficiently, predictably and lawfully manage and support staff.

## Who we share your personal information with

We don't share your personal information with third parties or sell it.

Because your personal information is stored on our IT systems, it's shared with our data processors who provide email, document management and storage services.

While your personal data is stored on our systems and shared with our data processors, it may be transferred and stored securely outside the European Union. Where this is the case it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of model contract clauses.

## How long we keep your personal information

People can always unsubscribe from our mailing list.

As a contact for a piece of work, we may contact you where a work matter requires your input. Once you leave the role, we'll update or delete the information we hold about you. This will take place at least once a year.

We keep staff data for [as long as is required by Dutch law](https://www.tuxx.nl/bewaartermijnen/documenten/#Algemene%20bedrijfsmatige%20documenten) (but no longer than 10 years).

## Changes to this information

You have the right to:

* know what personal information we have about you
* get a copy of the personal information we have about you in a machine readable format (only for people on our mailing list and people who have a contract with the Foundation)
* tell us if something's wrong so we can correct it
* ask us to stop processing your personal information under certain circumstances (known as '[the right to object to processing](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/)')
* have your personal information deleted

If you have a question or concern, please [contact us](contact-details.md). We hope we can resolve it for you - we'll do this within a month.
