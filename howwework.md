# How we work

We aim to model our values (being open and inclusive) in all of our work. In practice this means we're trying to work in the open as much as possible.

Here's more information about our internal processes.

In April 2019, we held a first [user mapping session](/users/index.md) to identify:
+ who we think our users are
+ what their motivations are for engaging with the Foundation for Public code
