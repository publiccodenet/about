The [About site](activities/documentation/index.md) is home to all of our staff information, decision-making rules and processes.
It is our staff manual that can be developed collaboratively with the community and reused by everyone.

It's `main` branch is the official ['source of truth'](GOVERNANCE.md) and central repository for all information about the Foundation for Public Code.

## Preview, build and deploy

The repository builds to a static site deployed at [about.publiccode.net](https://about.publiccode.net/).
It is built with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Releasing and deploying [is done with a release branch](activities/documentation/merge-develop-into-main.md).

We aim to deploy every Monday.

You can use the scripts:

* `./script/serve.sh` to serve the site locally with livereload
* `./script/test.sh` to run the tests including markdownlint and htmlproofer

The `test.sh` script takes the same steps as the [continuous integration tests](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/blob/develop/.github/workflows/test.yml).
It is comprised of

* `./script/test-markdown.sh` which uses the [`mdl`](https://rubygems.org/gems/mdl) linter to detect markdown errors and is yaml "front-matter" aware
* `./script/test-without-link-check.sh` which uses [`html-proofer`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/circleci/#html-proofer) to verify correct site construction
* `./script/check-new-links.sh` which extracts new links added by the patch and checks to see if they are valid

If run with `./script/test.sh --all`, then it also includes

* `./script/test-with-link-check.sh` which uses `html-proofer` to verify that all of the external links, even ones not related to the patch, are valid; a failure of this test may not be related to your work

The `test-with-link-check.sh` is [scheduled to run daily](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/blob/develop/.github/workflows/link-check.yml).
This helps the maintainers identify links which have gone stale.
