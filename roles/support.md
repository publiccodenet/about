# Codebase steward for support

Come help producers of open source software for public use – such as in cities and other public organizations – develop and maintain software and policy together. The Foundation for Public Code provides review of codebases that are in our stewardship to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and foster a strong community around it.

We test against the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) to make codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society and improve continually, and policy makers can keep technology and architectural choices open.

Part of this effort is to make reuse as easy as possible - for the public organizations that would benefit from using or contributing to these [codebases](../glossary/codebase-definition.md), it's not always easy to get started, know how to use or procure a solution like this, or even to trust the codebase.

## What the codebase steward for support does

As a codebase steward for support, you help remove technical obstacles to help potential reusers adopt and use a codebase.

This means you help:

* connect potential users to potential (trusted) vendors of solutions

* provide support for the community around a codebase to answer these questions themselves
* partake in the community

If you enjoy applying your expertise and network to solve gnarly technical and procurement problems, connecting problems with solutions, this role might be for you.
