# Codebase steward for support

The Foundation for Public Code helps public organizations – such as governments and cities – collaborate on solving their problems by developing Open Source solutions which, when reused, become more cost effective, of a higher quality, more resilient and attract more contributors.

For the public organizations that would benefit from using, or contributing to, these [Codebases](../glossary/codebase-definition.md) it might not always be easy to get started, know how to use or procure a solution like this or to trust in the Codebase.

As a Codebase Steward for Support you help:

* potential users find out how to use codebases
* provide assistance in procuring solutions based on codebases
* resolve issues in sales of solutions based on codebases
* connect potential users to potential (trusted) vendors of solutions
* provide a contact point for issues surrounding a codebase
* provide support for the community around a Codebase to answer these questions themselves
* partake in the community

This is a full time role in our main offices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Relocation possible. Compensation is competitive as well as in line with the public mission of the organization.
