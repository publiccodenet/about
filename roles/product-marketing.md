# Codebase steward for product marketing

Come help producers of open source software for public use – such as in cities and other public organizations – develop and maintain software and policy together. The Foundation for Public Code provides review of codebases that are in our stewardship to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and foster a strong community around it.

We test against the Standard for Public Code to make codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society and improve continually, and policy makers can keep technology and architectural choices open.

Part of this effort is to get a wider uptake for these codebases - reused codebases become more cost effective, higher quality, more resilient and more attractive to contributors. This means policy makers, management and developers in public organizations need to get to know the [codebases](../glossary/codebase-definition.md) and how to use them to solve their problems.

## What the codebase steward for product marketing does

As a codebase steward for product marketing, you work together with the community to make your codebase compelling to others. This means you help:

* make the codebase into a product
* provide branding for codebases so that they stand out from other – often proprietary – solutions
* build the communications channels necessary for getting the word out
* work to build a market for the codebase and the solution it provides
* help others sell the codebase to their management, coworkers or clients
* create a buzz around the codebase
* partake in the community

So if you delight in making codebases shine and connecting public purpose codebases to their ideal users, this may be the role for you.

### What we expect from all of our team members

You should:

* share our core values: openness, quality, trust, community, helpfulness
* understand the value of and be experienced with open source products and communities
* want to work for the public good
* have a collaborative work attitude and take pride in making things together
* be able to work independently
* be a strong communicator in English
* have international experience
* be an active participant in the codebase community you support
