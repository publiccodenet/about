# Codebase steward for quality

Come help producers of open source software for public use – such as governments and cities – improve the quality of their [codebases](../glossary/codebase-definition.md) by making them easier to understand, well documented and thus highly reusable.

[The Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net) helps public organizations develop and maintain software and policy together. We provide review of codebases that are in our stewardship to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and foster a strong community around it.

We test against the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/) to make codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society and improve continually, and policy makers can keep technology and architectural choices open.

## What the codebase steward for quality does

As a codebase steward for quality you work together with the community to make the codebases trusted, reliable and reusable. This means you will be:

* reviewing contributions to codebases for compliance with the Standard, and giving constructive and actionable feedback
* continually developing the Standard for Public Code

So, if you enjoy working together with a wide array of developers to make open source codebases really shine as well as improve the role of technology in society, this job is for you.

## What we expect from all of our team members

You should:

* share our core values: openness, quality, trust, community, helpfulness
* understand the value of and be experienced with open source products and communities
* want to work for the public good
* have a collaborative work attitude and take pride in making things together
* be able to work independently
* be a strong communicator in English
