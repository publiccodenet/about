# Codebase Steward, Quality

The Foundation for Public Code helps the developers of Open Source software for public use – such as in governments and cities – improve the quality of their [Codebases](../glossary/codebase.md) by making them easier to understand, well documented, and thus highly reusable. 

We provide review of contributions to Codebases that are in Codebase Stewardship at the Foundation for Public Code in order to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and can foster a strong community. We test against the quality Public Code standards for code and documentation we set which aim to make Codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure Codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society, improve continually, and keep technology and architectural choices open.

As a Codebase Steward, Quality you help:

* review pull requests and give feedback on the reusability, documentation and integrity of the codebase
* update the standards for quality Public Code that we use to test for
* partake in the community

If you enjoy working together with a wide array of developers to make Open Source codebases really shine as well as improve the role of technology in society, this is you.

This is a full time role in our main offices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Relocation possible. Compensation is competitive as well as in line with the public mission of the organization.
