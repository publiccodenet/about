# Codebase Steward, Quality

The Foundation For Public Code helps developers of Open Source software used for public uses – such as in governments and cities – make their [Codebases](../glossary/codebase.md) high quality so that they are understandable, well documented, easy to work with and highly reusable.

We provide review of contributions to Codebases that are in Codebase Stewardship at the Foundation For Public Code in order to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and can foster a strong community. We test against the quality Public Code standards for code and documentation we set which aim to make Codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high as well as opinionated to give trust the code can really serve as the infrastructure of society as well as continually improving with the changing world whilst keeping the choices of technology and architecture open.
