# Codebase steward for quality

The [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net) helps the producers of open source software for public use – such as in cities and other governmental organizations – improve the quality of their [codebases](../glossary/codebase.md) by making them easier to understand, well documented, and thus highly reusable.

We provide review of codebases that are in our stewardship to help developers build trusted and reliable software that can be widely reused and foster a strong community around it.

We test against the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) to make codebases understandable, reusable and community based. Our standards are high, as well as opinionated, to ensure codebases can be trusted as the infrastructure of society, improve continually, and policy makers can keep technology and architectural choices open.

## What do we expect from all our team members?

You must:

* share our core values: openness, quality, trust, community, helpfulness
* understand the value of and be experienced with open source products and communities
* want to work for the public good
* have a collaborative work attitude and take pride in making things together
* be able to work independently
* be a strong communicator in English
* have international experience

## What do we expect from our new codebase steward for quality?

We expect our new codebase steward to:

* be experienced in making great reusable open source software
* be an experienced maintainer in the open source community
* be motivated to help others make great reusable open source software
* be excited to help us create our process for codebase auditing
* be a programming languages polyglot
* be diplomatic, strategically aware and able to be a strong advocate for the organization
* be able to deliver constructive and actionable feedback

## What will our new codebase steward for quality be doing?

As a codebase steward for quality you work together with the community to make the codebases trusted, reliable and reusable. This means you will be:

* reviewing contributions to codebases for compliance with the Standard, and giving constructive and actionable feedback
* continually developing the Standard for Public Code
* playing an active role in the communities we work with

So, if you enjoy working together with a wide array of developers to make open source codebases really shine as well as improve the role of technology in society, this job is for you.
