# Do you have a desire to improve the work of local governments? 

And want to help public organizations build and maintain better services by building communities so that public organizations can work together on and share information about policy and open source software? 

# Become our codebase steward for community

The Foundation for Public Code helps public organizations develop and maintain software and policy together.

Part of this effort is to help the makers of open source software for public use – such as governments and cities – build communities around their [codebases](https://about.publiccode.net/glossary/codebase.html). This enables sharing of knowledge across organizations, makes codebases stronger and improves the quality of public services.

## What we expect from all of our team members

You should:

- share our core values: openness, quality, trust, community, helpfulness
- understand the value of and be experienced with open source products and communities
- want to work for the public good
- have a collaborative work attitude and take pride in making things together
- be able to work independently
- be a strong communicator in English
- have international experience
- be an active participant in the codebase community you support

## What we expect from the codebase steward for community

We expect our new codebase steward for community to:

- be a strong community builder and leader who brings together developers, designers, policy makers, managers and other stakeholders around the open source codebases the Foundation for Public Code has in its stewardship
- have experience with growing open source communities
- be excited to help us create our process for community management
- be diplomatic, strategically aware and able to be a strong advocate for the organization

## What the codebase steward for community does

- building and maintaining healthy communities through connecting members, and organizing events
