# Contributor Guide üôá‚Äç

The Foundation for Public Code has [a mission to develop an Open Source ecosystem for cities](../mission/index.md). In order to fulfil our mission we ‚Äì the directors of the Foundation, our advisors and contributors ‚Äì need your help!

This repository serves as the 'official source of truth' about the Foundation for Public Code. It contains all of its documentation, procedures and information as well as explanations on what the Foundation for Public Code does. We see it a bit like a 'living' charter.

In this guide we try to set out all the ways you can contribute to the Foundation for Public Code.

## How you can help

Outlined below are some ways you can help. Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Please be lovely to all other community members.

### Advise us and help us solve issues

Please look at [the list of Issues marked 'Help Wanted'](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/labels/help%20wanted), these are all of the issues (and proposed changes to content) where we feel we need help.

If you respond to an issue you will get notified by email of any new responses, you can reply to that email to reply in the thread. If you are interested in a certain discussion but do not want to post, use the 'Subscribe' button.

### Identify issues we need to solve

If you have any suggestion about our organisation, improvements to our documentation and communications or questions we invite you to [file an issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/issues/new).

For instance you could give us feedback on this guide, the [README](../README.md) or any other file in this repository.

Resolving these issues is a community effort as well, so be sure to clearly describe what you mean as others might not have the same context that you have.

Is your issue a question then it might be wise to follow the good survey question rules:

* Only single barreled issues (no X and Y issues)
* No negations in the issue title
* Issue title should be self-contained (related to remark above)
* Try to mitigate subjective interpretation (also related to remarks above)

### Suggest changes to content in Pull requests

Feel free to suggest changes to the content in a Pull Request.

This repository is automatically converted into a website with Jekyll and GitHub pages, so make sure that every file you contribute is valid [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you want to you can also [build and preview the website locally](../README.md) before making a Pull Request.

As per [the content governance guide](../GOVERNANCE.md) Pull Requests can only be merged into `develop` or `master` after being reviewed by a director.

### Contribute to our projects

And of course we'd love input into our projects as well, like the [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/).

## Becoming an advisor

If you provide us with meaningful contributions we might ask you to become an advisor. Our advisors are a group of subject matter experts from different fields that help us to progress the mission of the Foundation for Public Code and have a special position within the Foudation.

## Responsible disclosure and contact information

If you see an issue that should be resolved in private like a security or liability issue, please contact directors@publiccode.net.

If you have any other questions, feel free to make a new issue for them or email the directors at directors@publiccode.net.
