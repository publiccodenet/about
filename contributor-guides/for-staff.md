# How to staff at the Foundation for Public Code

Our staff are expected to follow and uphold both the [Community code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Staff code of conduct](../organization/staff-code-of-conduct.md). Make sure you are familiar with both.

Here are some important things to figure out in the first couple of days:

* [Using space guide](../activities/office-management/using-space.md) - how we use the spaces in the office
* Email - you should have an account, make sure you can send and receive
* Team Public Code chat - say hello, we're a welcoming bunch
* Calendar - add your holidays to the team calendar
* Manual of me - fill out your own and read the existing ones
* Github - push a branch, make a pull request (maybe to improve this page!)
* Splitwise - if you want to join the shared lunch groceries
* Attend morning standup ritual that is in the team calendar
* Attend sprint retrospective & planning - review the kanbans beforehand
* Tentoo NMBRS ESS (employee self service) mobile app. When setting up the app, use the following domain: "tentoo.nmbrs.nl" and log-in using your credentials - to [request leave](../activities/staff-management/leave.md), [file expenses](../activities/staff-management/expense.md) and see your payslips

Any of your new coworkers will be glad to help! <3

## Useful tools

These are some tools some of us find helpful:

* [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io/) - for collaborating on draft documents in Markdown with people outside the organization (especially helpful for content we plan to publish)
* [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/) - for formatting emails written using Markdown

## Useful context
