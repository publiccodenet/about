# How to staff at the Foundation for Public Code

Here are some important things to figure out in the first couple of days:

* Email - you should have an account, make sure you can send and receive
* Team Public Code chat - say hello, we're a welcoming bunch
* Calendar - add your holidays to the team calendar
* Manual of me - fill out your own and read the existing ones
* Github - push a branch, make a pull request (maybe to improve this page!)
* Splitwise - if you want to join the shared lunch groceries
* Rituals: standups - attend morning standups at 10:00
* Rituals: sprint retrospective & planning - review the kanbans beforehand

Any of your new coworkers will be glad to help! <3

## Useful tools
