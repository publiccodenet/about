# How to staff at the Foundation for Public Code

Our staff are expected to follow and uphold both the [Community code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Staff code of conduct](../organization/staff-code-of-conduct.md).
Make sure you are familiar with both.

In your work you will need to introduce and explain the Foundation for Public Code.
You'll answer questions about why we exist and what we do.
The [pitching guidance](../activities/communication/pitching.md) provides a good starting point to learn how to briefly explain our work to others.
We also provide a guide which describes our [communications activities](../activities/communication/index.md) and how we communicate with each other.

Here are some important things to figure out in the first couple of days:

* [Using space guide](../activities/office-management/using-space.md) - how we use the spaces in the office
* Email - you should have an account, make sure you can send and receive, you can also use a [standard email signature](../activities/communication/email-signature-template.md) to clearly convey who is communicating and build trust
* [Staff chat](../activities/communication/using-chat.md) - say hello, we're a welcoming bunch
* Calendar - add your holidays to the team calendar
* Manual of me - fill out your own and read the existing ones
* Odoo - We use [Odoo](../activities/tool-management/odoo.md) for project management and customer relations management
* Github - push a branch, make a pull request (maybe to improve this page!). If you are new to this, review [GitHub for newcomers](../activities/trainings/github-for-newcomers.md). Then start with a '[good first issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)'. You can request an invitation to have your Github account added to the [Foundation for Public Code](https://github.com/publiccodenet/) organizational account.
* Attend morning standup ritual that is in the team calendar
* Attend sprint retrospective & planning - review the kanbans beforehand
* Tentoo NMBRS ESS (employee self service) mobile app - to [request leave](../activities/staff-information/leave.md), [file expenses](../activities/staff-information/expense.md) and see your payslips
* If you already have a GitLab account you can [join the Foundation for Public Code group](https://gitlab.com/publiccodenet) although we don't do any work on GitLab.
* [Start contributing!](../activities/documentation/index.md)

We also have a [full list of tools](../activities/tool-management/index.md) we use.

It's important to understand that we strive to be an [open organization](../organization/cultural-values.md).
This means that we strive to use open licenses on everything we do.

The default license we use is [CC0 - Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0).

There are some exceptions to this.
If we need certainty that content will not be altered after publishing, we use [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).
For brand assets and trademarks we do not use a free license.
If external platforms don't provide CC 0, we use one that is as free and permissive as possible.

Any of your new coworkers will be glad to help! <3
