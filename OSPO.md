# Government Open Source Programme Offices: We can help you collaborate with the communities around a codebases

We help people collaborate on public code. Our focus is on the communities around a given codebase.

## If your open source progam office (OSPO) or organization is planning to:

* open up one of your codebases for other people to reuse and contribute to
* use an existing codebase to the extent that it becomes important to your organization, and you'd like to participate in its governance
* contribute your work back into a codebase (upstream) 
* work with third parties (especially vendors) to do any of the above

## Then we can help you, your organization's staff, and (potentially) the wider codebase community:

* [clarify and improve governance around the codebase](activities/supporting-codebase-governance/index.md)
* [develop good working practices that make collaboration easier and improve the quality of the codebase](https://standard.publiccode.net)
* [work on the communication, culture change and organizational values that come with collaboration in the open](https://publiccode.net/codebase-stewardship)

Email us at <info@publiccode.net> to start the discussion.
