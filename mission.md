# Mission of the Foundation For Public Code

We create a viable future for cities and civic operating systems that are highly participatory and drive societal engagement. A public digital infrastructure that is inclusive, usable, adaptive, open and sustainable.

To achieve this we maintain, manage, contribute to and grow an ecosystem of public software and policies that help governments, communities and citizens improve their city.
