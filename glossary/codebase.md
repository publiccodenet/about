# Codebase

Any discrete package of code (both source and policy), the tests and documentation required to implement a piece of policy or software.

This can be – for example – a document or a version-control repository.

Codebases of the [products stewarded by the Foundation for Public Code](../activities/codebase-stewardship/index.md) are hosted and managed by the Foundation for Public Code.
