# Codebase

Any discreet package of Code – both source and policy – tests and documentation required to instantiate a piece of policy or software.

This can be – for example – a document or a version-control repository.

Codebases of the [products Stewarded by the Foundation for Public Code](../activities/codebase-stewardship/index.md) are hosted and managed by the Foundation for Public Code.
