# Product

A product is a set of public code, packaged with documentation ready for re-use.
We support products over projects to acknowledge that code is not something you make and then abandon - it is not just about planning and control.
It is about collaborative innovation and maintenance with a focus on product availability, accessibility, and re-usability.
