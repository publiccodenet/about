# User

Someone who uses a codebase directly.

For example: if you use online form software to make and send a questionaire to someone, you are the user, they are the [End user](end-user-definition.md).
More examples are: civil servants reading the documentation of a codebase, infrastructure vendors installing it on their servers or system administrators administrating the systems.
