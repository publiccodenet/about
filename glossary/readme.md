The glossary serves to standardise the meaning of commonly used words and concepts in our communications.

## Adding a term to the glossary

If you want to add a term, please follow the steps set out in the [contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and these specific steps on your branch:

1. Create a new Markdown file named with the term, in lowercase and with hyphens (`-`) in stead of spaces, also known as kebab-case. For example: `public-code.md`.
2. Add the word to the `index.md` in the correct alphabetical order. For example: `* [Public code](publiccode.md)` between Public administration and Public sector.
