# About us

We help open source projects for public organizations to become successful, build sustainable communities around them and create a thriving public open source ecosystem.

[Our mission](organization/mission.md) is to enable public-purpose software and policy that is open and collaborative.

We do this through ecosystem level [codebase stewardship](activities/index.md) of both software and civic code, enabling collaboration and reuse at scale.

## Information and processes

The [About site](activities/documentation/index.md) is home to all of our staff information, decision-making rules and processes. It is our staff manual that can be developed collaboratively with the community and reused by everyone.
