# What we do

We help Open Source projects for cities become successful, build sustainable communities around them and create a thriving public Open Source ecosystem.

[Our mission](mission/index.md) is to create a viable future for cities and civic operating systems that are highly participatory and drive societal engagement.
We do this through ecosystem level [Codebase Stewardship](activities/index.md) of both computer and civic code enabling collaboration and re-use at scale.

## We need you

We can [really use your help](CONTRIBUTING.md) in setting up the Foundation for Public Code and making it successful.

The Foundation for Public Code is currently 'in founding', which means there is no judicial entity for it whilst we make sure we can get started with the right statutes.
