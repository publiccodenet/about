# About us

We help open source projects for public organizations to become successful, build sustainable communities around them and create a thriving public open source ecosystem.

[Our mission](organization/mission.md) is to enable public-purpose software and policy that is open and collaborative.

We do this through ecosystem level [codebase stewardship](activities/index.md) of both software and civic code, enabling collaboration and reuse at scale.

The documentation of our work here on [About](activities/documentation/index.md) is core to our ability to deliver on our mission together with the community effectively.
