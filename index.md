# What we do

We help open source projects for public organizations (like cities) become successful, build sustainable communities around them and create a thriving public open source ecosystem.

[Our mission](organization/mission.md) is to create a viable future for public organizations and civic operating systems that are highly participatory and drive societal engagement.

We do this through ecosystem level [codebase stewardship](activities/index.md) of both software and civic code enabling collaboration and re-use at scale.

The documentation of our work here on [About](activities/documentation/index.md) is core to our ability to deliver on our mission together with the community effectively.

Read more about:

* [our activities and services](activities/index.md) (starting summer 2019)
* [our organization](organization/index.md)
* [our roles and open positions](roles/index.md)
* [glossary of terms and concepts](glossary/index.md)

Additionally we have separate sites that show our [projects](https://projects.publiccode.net) and [how to use the brand](https://brand.publiccode.net/).

## We need you

We can [really use your help](CONTRIBUTING.md) in setting up the Foundation for Public Code and making it successful.
