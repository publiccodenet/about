# Content Governance

This project represents the Foundation For Public Code. Therefore any changes adopted into the `master` branch have to be accepted by the directors of the Foundation For Public Code. The `sprint` branch contains all features approved by at least one director and it represents the current 'working draft' version of the Foundation.

## New content and changes into the `sprint` branch

Every change and new feature can be accepted into the `develop` branch by any director that did not open that Pull Request.

## Publishing the changes from `sprint` to `master`

All of the changes in `develop` are agreed upon in by all directors of the Foundation For Public Code before they can be merged and are accepted as 'truth'. This usally happens in the weekly directors meeting.
