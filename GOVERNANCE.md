# Content governance

This project represents the Foundation for Public Code. Therefore any changes adopted into the `master` branch have to be accepted by the directors of the Foundation for Public Code. The `sprint` branch contains all features approved by at least one director and it represents the current 'working draft' version of the Foundation.

## New content and changes into the `sprint` branch

Every change and new feature can be accepted into the `develop` branch by any director that did not open that pull request.

## Publishing changes from `sprint` to `master`

All of the changes in `develop` are agreed upon by all directors of the Foundation for Public Code before they can be merged and are accepted as 'truth'. This usually happens in the weekly directors meeting.
