# Content governance

This project represents the Foundation for Public Code.
Therefore any changes adopted into the `main` branch have to be accepted by the directors of the Foundation for Public Code.
The `develop` branch contains all features approved by at least one other committer and it represents the current 'working draft' version of the Foundation.

## New content and changes into the `develop` branch

Every change and new feature should be made towards the `develop` branch.
Staff at the Foundation for Public Code will review the pull request and it can be accepted by any director that did not open that pull request.

## Publishing changes from `develop` to `main`

All of the changes in `develop` are agreed upon by all directors of the Foundation for Public Code before they can be [published on About](/activities/documentation/merge-develop-into-main.md), and are accepted as 'truth'.
