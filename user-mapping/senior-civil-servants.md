# Senior civil servants

This group includes senior civil servants at these levels:

* EU
* national
* membership bodies or associations (for example of cities)
* provincial  
* municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* distributes risk of development
* sense of ownership, pride or craft
* enlarge communities of practice and share resources
* re-approachability/maintenance
* trust and security of public services and underlying technology

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

* vendor lock in leads to costly maintenance
* policy changes impossible to implement in closed, constrained software
* software, contractor or genius empoloyee can suddenly vanish
* no technological sovereignty (tech dependence)
* very hard to find tech talent in the public sector

## Our value proposition for them

We enable:

* easier implementation of policy into technology
* higher quality public services
* more cost effective implementation, maintenance and upgrading
* agility for future growth paths
