# Political

This group includes political leaders at these levels:

- EU 
- national
- provincial  
- municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ translate local policy changes into tech solutions
+ public opinion shifting towards critique of tech giants
+ a place to stash work before leaving office
+ involve local partners and stimulate the local economy
+ access higher level government funding
 
Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ data and processes owned by private actors
+ poor resident experience is politically costly
+ companies evolve to rip off government
+ high failure rate of huge IT projects
+ political change keeps cutting successes of opponent, which are then lost

## Our value proposition for them

We enable:
- policy accurately reflected by tech implementation
- local control (technological sovereignty)
- strengthen the local economy
- building lasting value that transcends the political cycle
