## Mission
To grow an ecosystem of public purpose open source policy and software.

## Principles

1. We are a non-profit and non-partisan organization.
2. We publish under licences approved by the Open Source Initiative or Creative Commons licences that do not limit commercial reuse.
3. We are controlled by our members, who are wholly publicly controlled organisations.
4. We strive to keep our membership as accessible as possible to potential members, regardless of size or location.
5. We are committed to working with other organizations (commercial or non-profit) to achieve our mission.
6. We prioritise the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. 
7. Our work is open by default and welcomes contributions.
