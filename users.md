# User research brain storming session (part 1)

Hypotheses to test for user research, organised by probable user groups.

## Decision makers and sponsors

### Political

This group includes political leaders at these levels:

- EU 
- national
- provincial  
- municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ translate local policy changes into tech solutions
+ public opinion shifting towards critique of tech giants
+ a place to stash work before leaving office
+ involve local partners and stimulate the local economy
+ access higher level government funding
 
Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ data and processes owned by private actors
+ poor resident experience is politically costly
+ companies evolve to rip off government
+ high failure rate of huge IT projects
+ political change keeps cutting successes of opponent, which are then lost

#### Our value proposition for them

We enable:
- policy accurately reflected by tech implementation
- local control (technological sovereignty)
- strengthen the local economy
- building lasting value that transcends the political cycle

### Senior civil servants

This group includes senior civil servants at these levels:
- EU 
- national
- membership bodies or associations (for example of cities)
- provincial  
- municipal

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ distributes risk of development
+ sense of ownership, pride or craft
+ enlarge communities of practice and share resources
+ re-approachability/maintenance
+ trust and security of public services and underlying technology

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ vendor lock in leads to costly maintenance
+ policy changes impossible to implement in closed, constrained software
+ software, contractor or genius empoloyee can suddenly vanish
+ no technological sovereignty (tech dependence)
+ very hard to find tech talent in the public sector

#### Our value proposition for them

We enable:

- easier implementation of policy into technology
- higher quality public services
- more cost effective implementation, maintenance and upgrading
- agility for future growth paths

### Structural funding and philanthropy

This includes:
+ foundations and NGOs
+ high net worth individuals

Positive reasons for why they might be interested in our work:

+ get the most out of other tech impact investments
+ enable myriad public institutions with one investment

Negative reasons for why they might be interested in our work:
+ Facebook, Uber et al now seen as villains - winners need to give back
+ other NGOs offer one-off solutions and consulting, but what's needed are structural platforms

#### Our value proposition for them
